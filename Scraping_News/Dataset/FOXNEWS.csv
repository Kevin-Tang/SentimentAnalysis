Her letter was in response to a letter signed last month by ten attorneys general who opposed online gaming.The ten Republican attorneys general sent their letter Nov. 17 to Pence asking him to consider the Restoration of Americaâ€™s Wire Act (RAWA). Nevadaâ€™s Attorney General, Adam Laxalt, was a cosigner of the letter.The Restoration of Americaâ€™s Wire Act is legislation that would effectively ban all online gambling nationwide with the exception of daily fantasy sports websites and horse race betting.In her letter, Titus contends that â€œthe letter submitted by the attorneys general contains several inaccuracies and unfair allegations.â€ù Titus touted regulations in place in Nevada, which she says prove online gambling can be effectively regulated. â€œGaming regulation in the state of Nevada is considered the international gold standard,â€ù she added.CYBERGAMBLING RETURNS â€“ AND THIS TIME ITâ€™S LEGALThe Restoration of Americaâ€™s Wire Act would rewrite and reinterpret the federal Wire Act of 1961, which is also known as the Interstate Wire Act.The AG letter cited addiction, divorce and increased suicide as harmful effects of online gambling. The AGs also raised concerns about anonymity, which they said could be used to support terrorist financing and criminal activity.However, in her letter, Titus warned of the ramifications that could arise from banning online gambling from states that are doing it correctly. She said, â€œI encourage you [Trump] to carefully study this issue before making any decisions that would infringe on stateâ€™s rights or eliminate jobs in the gaming industry.â€ùState-regulated online gambling is legal in Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey.The Restoration of Americaâ€™s Wire Act was introduced in the 2015 session of Congress and is still sitting in the Senate Judiciary Committee, according to Congress.gov. The legislation was written with the backing of Las Vegas hotel and casino billionaire, Sheldon Adelson, an opponent of online gambling."foxnews,Harvard's Mankiw: Trump Should Stop Micromanaging Corporate America,"President-elect Donald Trump continues to promote his economic growth agenda, standing by his campaign promises of slashing the corporate tax rate and decreasing regulations. Last week, Trump announced that he had struck a deal with Indiana-based Carrier Corp., saving 1,000 jobs from being exported to Mexico.Continue Reading BelowTrump may have mastered the art of the deal when it came to saving jobs at Carrier, but how will his business-like approach affect the U.S. economic system?In an interview on the FOX Business Networkâ€™s Countdown to the Closing Bell, Harvard Economics Professor Greg Mankiw said the President-elect shouldnâ€™t be meddling in the affairs of corporate America, and his decision to do so may not be beneficial for the economy in the long run.â€œThereâ€™s a big difference between being a CEO of a company and being President of the United States. A CEO is basically a central planner for that company. The President of the United States is not the central planner for the U.S. economy,â€ù Mankiw said.The former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under Bush 43 said it is highly unlikely that a president alone would be able to make the best decisions on behalf of the businesses and workers that keep the economy going.â€œWe fundamentally believe in a market economy, that is decentralized decision making, not decision making centralized in one person, the President of the United States,â€ù he said.Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENTAlthough Trumpâ€™s ambitious efforts to save every job in the U.S. will benefit a subset of workers, Mankiw said allowing the free market to make these decisions is the best way of promoting economic growth.â€œI think a lot of his [Trump] economic advisors people like Larry Kudlow and Steve Moore are believers in that principle and my guess is behind the scenes, they are not so enthusiastic about the some of this micromanaging,â€ù Mankiw said."foxnews,Bart Chilton: Trump is now dealmaker-in-chief,foxnews,"Tom On Trumpâ€™s Boeing Threat: â€œEven If Itâ€™s Populist Propaganda, I love It!â€ù","Donald Trump is back on Twitter!

He attacked her Senate vote in support of the war in Iraq and war-weary Democrats rallied to him.With Obama leaving office, the Democrats are losing his anti-war focus and the personal popularity that allowed him to hold the Democrats together. The president enjoys a sky-high job approval rating among his fellow Democrats.So, who replaces him as the working leader of Democrats in Washington? And what is the Democratsâ€™ new guiding ideology?The leading candidate to lead the party out of the darkness is Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.). He is widely expected to be the next Senate Minority Leader. But his strong ties to Wall Street are guaranteed to give the most liberal members of his party heartburn.House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), with 30 years in Congress, is expected to remain the top Democrat in the House. But the first woman to serve as Speaker of the House lost the majority in 2010 and failed to recapture it in any of the three elections since then.Over at the Democratic National Committee (DNC), there is also a leadership vacuum.Former chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (Fla.) was forced out after WikiLeaks published embarrassing emails showing DNC staffers trying to help Clinton defeat Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the Democratic primaries.Donna Brazile, the current DNC chairwoman, is under fire for emails, again released through WikiLeaks, that claim to show she shared presidential debate questions with the Clinton campaign while a paid contributor at CNN.At the moment, Democrats are a people distressed at the reality that millions of Americans voted for Trump â€” and did so with full knowledge of his long list of insults, bullying, racist comments and failure to pay taxes. Exit polls showed voters selecting him despite their overwhelming conclusion that he lacks the judgment and experience to be president.I sincerely hope the president-elect lives up to his promise to â€œbind the wounds of division.â€ù Patriotism dictates that Democrats rally behind him and pray for his success as our nationâ€™s leader. I am trying. It is also good to remember there are lots of Democrats out there. Clinton won the popular vote even as she lost the Electoral College.If Trump really does try to improve the employment situation for working class people, Democrats should be ready to support him, a recent piece by D.D. Guttenplan in The Nation argued â€” even while they develop the power to pressure him on immigration and climate change.Democrats need a revived party with a strong leader, as well as a clear message that allows them to stand as the loyal opposition to Trump Republicans.One way to find the leader is to consider the best Democrat to run against Trump in 2020. International Business Times last week listed six names for the job: Sen. Sherrod Brown (Ohio); Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro; New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo; Clintonâ€™s running mate Sen. Tim Kaine (Va.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.).â€œI want an uncompromising fighter who understands the values of our base, of our party, and of our nation,â€ù Markos Moulitsas wrote at the Daily Kos last week in a blog post on who should be the next DNC Chair. â€œI want a champion who will rebuild the party in all 50 states. I want a hero that will support a whole new generation of new party leaders, candidates, activists and voters. And I want anger. But that may just be the day-after me speaking.â€ùIn a Facebook post last Wednesday, liberal filmmaker Michael Moore urged activists to â€œtake over the Democratic Party and return it to the people,â€ù because â€œthey have failed us miserably.â€ùâ€œAny Democratic member of Congress who didnâ€™t wake up this morning ready to fight, resist and obstruct in the way Republicans did against President Obama every day for eight full years must step out of the way and let those of us who know the score lead the way in stopping the meanness and the madness thatâ€™s about to begin,â€ù Moore wrote.The progressive populist wing of the Democratic Party, as currently led by Sanders and Warren, has a real opportunity in the coming months to execute a hostile takeover of the Democratic Party, just as Trump took over the Republicans last year.The internal power struggles within the Democratic Party provide clues to how the partyâ€™s congressional leaders will deal with pressing issues like pending trade deals, where progressives like Sanders and Warren may find common cause with Trump in opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Then there is the Supreme Court, where an all-out fight will be required after Senate Republicans never even had a hearing to consider Obamaâ€™s nominee, Merrick Garland.Other Trump GOP agenda items like the repeal of ObamaCare and sweeping tax cuts will require progressives to go to the barricades. They will need new ideas and strong leadership and it is not at all clear that their current roster is up to the challenge.Bernie and Elizabeth, the party is yours for the taking. The opening is there for you to channel all of the pain and anger among Democrats. Will you seize it?Juan Williams is a co-host of FNC's ""The Five,"" where he is one of seven rotating Fox personalities."foxnews,"City council declares Santa Ana, CA, sanctuary city, but questions remain","A group in full support of making Santa Ana a sanctuary city rallied outside the city council on Tuesday.With a unanimous vote, the council passed a resolution declaring the city safe for people despite their immigration status.Itâ€™s the first resolution of itâ€™s kind in Orange County, but activists want more.â€œWe donâ€™t just want symbolic language we want policy we want an ordinance we want action,â€ù Roberto Herrera said.Under the resolution, the city wonâ€™t use any money or resources to enforce federal immigration law. It also directs police not to target anyone based on documentation, but it doesnâ€™t develop any new enforceable policies.Activists also see a problem with the city allowing ICE to operate in the jail.â€œThatâ€™s basically contradictory you are saying we have sanctuary city, but then you have a contract with ICE in your jail thatâ€™s not a sanctuary city,â€ù advocate Victor Valladares said.The city has agreed to reduce the space allocated to ICE, but the contract isnâ€™t up until 2020.Council members will also consider making the sanctuary city resolution a law.For more Southern California stories visit fox11news.com.Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram"foxnews,'Fox News Sunday' Brings You an Exclusive Interview with Donald Trump,foxnews,Industry icons walk the red carpet at The Game Awards 2016,foxnews,BIAS ALERT: Time 'Honors' Trump as Person of the Year But Also Brands Him a 'Huckster' While Calling Clinton 'An American Moses',"Published December 07, 2016 | FoxNews.comPresident-elect Donald Trump was named Time magazine's Person of the Year on Wednesday â€“ and the honor basically ended there.While describing Trump as the real change-maker of 2016, the magazine also ragged on the Republican president-elect as a â€œhucksterâ€ù and â€œdemagogueâ€ù while reserving its most glowing praise for runner-up Hillary Clinton -- whom the edition breathlessly described as â€œan American Moses.â€ùIn describing Trump, Time's article almost exclusively used backhanded compliments. For instance, while the piece said he â€œdid what no American politician had attempted in a generation,â€ù it added that he â€œmagnified the divisions of the present, inspiring new levels of anger and fear within his country.â€ùâ€œNow itâ€™s difficult to count all the ways Trump remade the game: the huckster came off more real than the scripted political pros.

The demagogue won more Latino and black votes than the 2012 Republican nominee,â€ù Time's Michael Scherer said in one particularly bruising paragraph.Among the descriptions of what it called â€œTrumpâ€™s America,â€ù Time described a land â€œwhere a hijab-wearing college student in New York reports being attacked and jeered at in the next Presidentâ€™s name, where American-born children ask their citizen parents if Trump will deport them, where white supremacists throw out Nazi salutes in Washington meeting halls for their President-elect.â€ù [It is worth noting that President Obama is still in charge until Januar"foxnews,'Game of Thrones' star wants everyone to stop going to dolphin shows,"""Game of Thrones"" star Maisie Williams wants everyone to stop buying tickets to marine shows.

The overall number of traffic accidents involving drivers aged 75 and up has risen from 7.4 percent to 12.8 percent in the last decade according to the national police agency. At the same time, there's been a nationwide decline in vehicular accidents overall across the country.Older drivers in Aichi are entitled to ramen discounts after presenting his or her driving record certificate, which can be obtained from police in exchange for handing in a license, local media reports say. With the 15 percent discount, a meal at Sugakiya with ramen, rice and salad costs just 500 yen-- about $4.40.Japan isn't the only country that's considered using food as an incentive to make things safer. In June 2015, a jail in Indiana explored a program that would allow inmates with good behavior records to order pizza and takeout from local restaurants. And in August, a restaurant in Indianapolis contemplated trading free pizzas for guns handed in off the street.ANTHONY BOURDAIN'S FAVORITE NEW YORK CITY HOTSPOTS FOR JAPANESE FOODIn Japan, officials have also used non-edible incentives to improve street safety. Many drivers can take advantage of similar incentives, including discounts at public baths, barbers and chemists and reduced taxi fares.Prior to the ramen concession being introduced, 12,000 drivers in the prefecture had taken advantage of the offers this year."foxnews,NASCAR Puts on the Brakes Until 2017,"The cars are in the garage, the drivers are unbuckled and when NASCAR returns, things wonâ€™t look the same.FOXâ€™s Chris Hoenig has â€œFOX in the Fast Laneâ€ù:Drivers get back at it in February with the Unlimited and Can-Am duels, leading up to the Daytona 500 on February 26, live on FOX.When they get back in their cars, they wonâ€™t be vying for the Sprint Cup.

No children were on board at the time of the crash.The transit bus driver and four passengers were also killed. Eleven people were injured.Reports referencing Chappell's previous crashes and other incidents said Chappell had ""seizure-like episodes."" Chappell had an actual seizure just a week before the Nov. 1 crash.In addition, while Chappell had a medical certificate allowing him to drive the school bus, he had not filed it with the Maryland Vehicle Administration, which made it illegal for him to be driving the bus, the report said.Chappell's wife told investigators after an earlier crash that he had been taking medication for seizures when he got into an accident two years ago.Chappell had been driving buses since 2008. He began working for AAAfordable in 2014, but took a break between April and August of this year, during which time he drove for other bus companies.Shawn Braxton, who was behind the wheel of the Ford Mustang, was shocked to learn that Chappell had both a history of car crashes and a known medical condition.""That's just crazy,"" Braxton said in an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday.""I'm upset about it, and saddened because he felt the need to continue to drive the bus even though he had a medical condition, and I'm saddened that the bus company kept him hired because he had a medical condition and they should have been monitoring him,"" he said.The NTSB is also investigating a school bus crash in Chattanooga, Tennessee in which six children died and 12 others were admitted to the hospital. The bus was carrying 37 children at the time of the wreck. The driver, Jonathan Walker, has been charged with multiple counts of vehicular homicide. Records showed that students had complained about Walker's driving, and that he'd been in an accident just two months before the wreck.Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh, who was sworn in Tuesday morning, said in a statement that she is ""very concerned about the way bus drivers are cleared for duty.""""We entrust the lives of our children to these public servants, so we need to make sure they are up to the task,"" Pugh said.Dr. Stephen Richards, director of the Southeastern Transportation Center at the University of Tennessee, who reviewed the preliminary report, said the lack of communication between the MVA and the school system about Chappell's outdated medical certificate could be an area that needs attention.""The fact that no certificate had been turned in, and the public agency that kept track of that certificate ... had recognized that he should not be driving, that's where the breakdown occurred,"" Richards said.

Her letter was in response to a letter signed last month by ten attorneys general who opposed online gaming.The ten Republican attorneys general sent their letter Nov. 17 to Pence asking him to consider the Restoration of Americaâ€™s Wire Act (RAWA). Nevadaâ€™s Attorney General, Adam Laxalt, was a cosigner of the letter.The Restoration of Americaâ€™s Wire Act is legislation that would effectively ban all online gambling nationwide with the exception of daily fantasy sports websites and horse race betting.In her letter, Titus contends that â€œthe letter submitted by the attorneys general contains several inaccuracies and unfair allegations.â€ù Titus touted regulations in place in Nevada, which she says prove online gambling can be effectively regulated. â€œGaming regulation in the state of Nevada is considered the international gold standard,â€ù she added.CYBERGAMBLING RETURNS â€“ AND THIS TIME ITâ€™S LEGALThe Restoration of Americaâ€™s Wire Act would rewrite and reinterpret the federal Wire Act of 1961, which is also known as the Interstate Wire Act.The AG letter cited addiction, divorce and increased suicide as harmful effects of online gambling. The AGs also raised concerns about anonymity, which they said could be used to support terrorist financing and criminal activity.However, in her letter, Titus warned of the ramifications that could arise from banning online gambling from states that are doing it correctly. She said, â€œI encourage you [Trump] to carefully study this issue before making any decisions that would infringe on stateâ€™s rights or eliminate jobs in the gaming industry.â€ùState-regulated online gambling is legal in Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey.The Restoration of Americaâ€™s Wire Act was introduced in the 2015 session of Congress and is still sitting in the Senate Judiciary Committee, according to Congress.gov. The legislation was written with the backing of Las Vegas hotel and casino billionaire, Sheldon Adelson, an opponent of online gambling."foxnews,"AT&T CEO: Letting Us Buy Time Warner Will 'Disrupt' TV, Be 'Good for Consumers'","When AT&T announced in October that it would spend $85 billion to acquire Time Warner, the plan was met with strong headwinds right out of the gate. A surprisingly broad array of lawmakers, from both sides of the political aisle, immediately voiced concerns. Among the concerned parties? The Senate Judiciary Committee, which today held a hearing examining the impact on competition, and potential antitrust concerns, the merger could raise.As you would expect, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson thinks that letting his company snap up Time Warner will be great for everyone, especially AT&T. In his prepared testimony [PDF], Stephenson said that together, the two companies â€œwill disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models,â€ù give consumers more options, increase competition for cable TV providers, and, somehow, speed up the development and deployment of 5G wireless networks.Disruption in the pay-TV industry is, of course, already happeningâ€”and AT&T is already a participant. Not only is premium content now available online through services like HBO Now and Netflix, but also with the rise of streaming bundles like DirecTV Now, Dishâ€™s Sling TV, PlayStation Vue, and upcoming offerings from Hulu, â€œcableâ€ù has indeed begun to break open.â€œThese changes to the old TV model unquestionably have been good for consumers,â€ù Stephenson asserts. â€œBut consumers want and deserve more options and better choices.â€ùRelated Stories From Consumer ReportsSo how does the merger make that happen, exactly? The same way these things always do, in the end: money. Stephenson wants AT&T to own more content because then they donâ€™t have to pay third parties to get it on their own streaming service, DirecTV Now.Because while the method of deliveryâ€”streaming vs coaxial cableâ€”might be new, some things havenâ€™t changed: the content companies that own media still want the distribution companies to pay them for access to those networks and that content.Stephenson doesnâ€™t just hint at that reasoning; he states it outright. â€œCurrently, our ability to bring customers more of what they want has been constrained because we own very little of our own programming,â€ù Stephenson writes. â€œInstead, we have to negotiate [distribution] matters with third-party content owners, and in a fast-changing marketplace like video, it is particularly difficult to obtain flexibility . . . This transaction will help us break out of that box and reshape the competitive landscape.â€ùHe continues by describing how owning content will let AT&T optimize it and deliver it more readily on a variety of platforms, including mobile, because the company wouldnâ€™t have to seek rights agreements. â€œWe will be able to innovate more quickly, experiment more readily, tweak our offerings as we gauge customer response, and bring consumers the options they seek,â€ù Stephenson says. â€œWe want to give customers more control of how they watch their video content . . . we are in an ideal position to do that because of our own mobile network . . . we expect to deliver mobile-optimized content and services, and ad-supported services that shift more costs from consumers to advertisers.â€ùIf Stephensonâ€™s comments are to be taken at face value, then what he alludes to throughout is not just the desirability but the necessity of vertical integration going forward in the 21st century. Acquiring content costs money; thus, owning content allows you to streamline deals and save money. And when you own that content, you can arrange to give it preferential treatment. Making your internet traffic travel faster, or slowing down a competitorsâ€™s, is now against the law thanks to the Open Internet Order of 2015 (aka, net neutrality), but exempting your own traffic from data caps you imposeâ€”zero-ratingâ€”is still something you can get away with, even if the FCC does have â€œconcernsâ€ù that it may harm consumers.Despite that leverage, however, Stephenson says that â€œit would be a gross mistake to view this transaction as anything but pro-competitive. This transaction is a vertical deal between two firms operating in separate marketsâ€”one in content distribution, the other in content production . . . AT&Tâ€™s and Time Warnerâ€™s businesses complement each other, and those complementary businesses, when combined, naturally result in consumer and competitive benefits.â€ùOpponents and critics, however, see anything but â€œnaturalâ€ù benefits for consumers.Our colleagues down the hall at Consumers Union (the policy and mobilization arm of our parent company, Consumer Reports), also submitted testimony to the committee [PDF], which Sen. Amy Klobuchar (MN) added to the record.In their testimony, Consumers Union points out that consumers benefit most from competitionâ€”and that mergers are, well, the opposite of that.â€œOne key to empowering consumers to protect themselves is working to ensure meaningful consumer choice, through effective competition,â€ù Consumers Union writes. â€œWhen consumers have meaningful choice, businesses are stimulated to provide more affordability, better quality, and new innovative thinking. By effective competition, we mean a marketplace marked by a fair and level playing field, where companies earn consumers with better products, lower prices, and attractive offerings and can compete free of exclusive deals and other monopolistic and anti-competitive barriers.â€ùContinued media consolidation, CU continues, is basically the opposite of that, â€œdespite the claims to the contrary always put forward by the merging parties.â€ùFor one thing, mergers like thisâ€”as weâ€™ve seen in the five years since Comcast snapped up NBCUniversalâ€”donâ€™t actually result in lower prices, CU points out. Programming and distribution costs keep going up, across the board, no matter who buys whom.So whatâ€™s really up? CU posits that AT&T is seeking not only money, but relevance. â€œA likely reasonâ€ù for the merger, CU suggests, â€œis that AT&T, as one of the nationâ€™s largest providers of wireless, pay-TV, and broadband service, is trying to position itself not to be relegated to the simple function of a utility just providing the connection that other use to make money supplying program content to consumers.â€ùBecause if that were all, in a competitive marketplace, consumers could feel free to walk away and switch providersâ€”something cable consumers canâ€™t usually do, but wireless and satellite customers can.â€œIf we believe the conventional wisdom that â€˜content is king,'â€ù CU continues, â€œthen acquiring content created and owned by Time Warner is AT&Tâ€™s gambit to prevent itself from being commoditized into, and to enable it to evolve into something more than a mere telecommunications company.â€ùAnd by becoming a content company, the testimony adds, AT&T â€œcould seek to maximize the value of this premium content [that Time Warner owns] in ways that could hurt consumers and competition.â€ùStephenson claims that withholding Time Warner content from competitors would make no sense, since the idea behind programming is to get it in front of as many eyes as possible. And to a point thereâ€™s something there, CU agrees, but in business, well, business tends to reign paramount. â€œAT&T might decide not to restrict content when negotiating with other large MVPDs [pay-TV companies, traditional or streaming] who also own contentâ€”and therefore, have their own leverageâ€”like Comcast-NBCU. But what about a small rural cable operator who does not own content, and possesses such a small subscriber base as to be at the mercy of whatever price AT&T decides to insist on for HBO or CNN?â€ùAnd of course, CU continues, there is the problem of zero-rating. â€œUnder [AT&Tâ€™s] â€˜Sponsored Dataâ€™ plan,â€ù CU writes, â€œDirecTV pays AT&T Mobility for zero-rated data service and other, unaffiliated video providers, such as Netflix or Charter, are reportedly able to obtain the service at the same rate. But because the payment from DirecTV to AT&T Mobility is AT&T simply moving money from one of its pockets to another, there is potential for anti-competitive cross-subsidizationâ€”the same payment does not â€˜costâ€™ them as much as it costs the independents.â€ùThatâ€™s how preferential treatment benefits companies: someone concerned about potentially incurring high fees for going over their mobile data limit is going to be more likely to gravitate to a service that doesnâ€™t count against that limit. That means other companiesâ€”say something like Sling TV, theoreticallyâ€”would either have to pay AT&T for access to zero-rate their customers, or AT&T customers would instead potentially avoid it in favor of something that spares them data costs. Either way, AT&T wins.â€œWe view the choice between these two outcomes as a â€˜double whammyâ€™ that hurts competition in the emerging market of streaming, over-the-top wireless video,â€ù CU concludes.AT&T is, of course, not alone here, as CU notes. Comcast/NBCU is the biggest merger of media and content companies in recent years, but itâ€™s not the only one. Verizon, too, has been trying to move into content, with extremely limited success. Still, its acquisition of AOL and pending attempt to buy Yahoo are both with an eye to expanding its advertising and media presence.Copyright Â© 2005-2016 Consumers Union of U.S., Inc.

""It's not on a real foundation and it's slowly tilting and leaning and listing. And we just, we really wanted to preserve the cabin.""ZION NATIONAL PARK MAY START LIMITING TOURISTSThe state is also working to build a parking lot big enough for 20 cars and four buses.""We took some counts,"" Bushman said. ""We were getting between 60 and 90 cars a day stopping here, out on the highway.""The cabin is currently owned by Afton Morgan, but many believe it is where Cassidy grew up. Cassidy, whose real name was Robert Leroy Parker, was born in Beaver in 1866 and the Parker family did live in the Circleville cabin. It is unknown if Cassidy lived there with his family of if he had already left to live the life of an outlaw.""There's a lot of rumors of that,"" Morgan said. ""But to the best of our knowledge, Butch came here when he was just a young boy. I've heard all the way from 8 to 12 years old.""Fred Hayes, director of the Utah Division of State Parks, said his agency will develop information signs for the historic site. He said the division will do its best to get the history right, including the ongoing debate on whether or not the law ever caught Cassidy.HOW MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY DIE IN NATIONAL PARKS?In the popular 1969 movie about the outlaw, ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" the gang of outlaws flees to South America and dies in a shootout in 1908.

Mike Enzi: My plan to put Congress on a 'diet' and fix our broken budget process,"As this year draws to a close, we are once again approaching a federal budget deadline that will likely be postponed. Over the last 40 years, since the modern budget process was established, Congress has enacted 175 temporary spending bills, formally known as â€˜continuing resolutions,â€™ to avoid doing its job. Itâ€™s time to change the way Congress does business.The November election results showed that hardworking taxpayers are eager for real change. With a new president taking office on January 20th, Congress has an opportunity â€“ and responsibility â€“ to get back to work.The first step must be fixing Americaâ€™s broken budget process to provide our nation with a responsible fiscal blueprint and help guide our spending decisions now and into the future. As chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, this will be one of my top priorities in the new congress.We are a nation on course for a fiscal disaster, because when it comes to spending money, Congress is like a binge eater. We donâ€™t want to start our diet until right AFTER the next dessert. That attitude has led to a mammoth, oversized national debt that, left unchecked, will crush the prosperity of future generations.We must start spending within our means and establish healthy fiscal habits. Unfortunately, Americaâ€™s broken budget process makes it easy for Congress to spend without ever checking its fiscal waist line.Currently, only thirty percent of the national budget is annually distributed to federal agencies and programs by Congress. This money funds the activities that most people would associate with good government, such as national defense, education, and infrastructure spending.We must pass spending bills to fund these government activities every year, forcing a public debate about where taxpayer dollars should be spent.In fact, this is the portion of the budget that attracts the most congressional scrutiny and debate, and there are limits in place that make it very difficult to spend more than whatâ€™s allotted. But it is not growing rapidly and is not the cause of our unsustainable fiscal course.The real culprit is the other seventy percent of the federal budget that is spent automatically, without regular congressional action or review.In just 15 years, it will consume ALL government revenues, as debt interest payments and entitlements continue to grow rapidly. There are no effective limits to the amount that can be spent on this side of the budget, at least until this spending drives America into bankruptcy.This is how the budget process makes it easy to spend money. There is regular review and strict limits on the small and shrinking portion of the budget. But the much larger automatic spending programs are not regularly reviewed and can grow almost without limit.To make matters worse, the historically low interest rates that America has relied on to pay its debt are poised to surge, according to the latest signals from the Federal Reserve. When these rates rise, we can expect to spend more every year on interest payments for these loans than we spend on national defense.The Senate Budget Committee has been working on reforms that would fix Americaâ€™s broken budget process. Many of these reforms strengthen the congressional budget, the only existing tool we have that forces Congress to examine all spending and revenues, including automatic spending, over a ten-year period. This budgeting process should be easier to adopt and harder to ignore. Congress can start by reducing the needless political hurdles to passing a budget and making it harder to ignore overspending once Congress agreed to it.The congressional budget is easily ignored in the Senate because it takes the same number of votes in the Senate to waive a budget violation that it does to overcome filibuster and pass a bill. The fiscal year 2016 budget was tossed aside in less than 5 weeks. Our rules should make it harder to pass a bill that busts the congressional budget by requiring more votes to waive the violation.We must also create new rules to ensure Congress passes its annual spending measures on time. The current process has been completed on time only four times in the last 40 years, and the last time it was completed on time was in 1998.Obviously this year is no exception to the rule. Congress should set aside specific floor time only for consideration of spending bills and enact legislation establishing a two-year spending cycle, so that it has more time to review spending and complete its work. It should also enact Senator Portmanâ€™s legislation that would end government shutdowns to prevent our annual, end-of-year spending crises.These reforms and others would begin to create healthy fiscal habits that would force Congress to recognize and begin to address the daunting fiscal challenges that face our country.I will continue to tirelessly work to get as many of these budget reforms as possible enacted in the new Congress. Itâ€™s time to take seriously the crisis that is threatening the future financial solvency of this country.The American people have spoken, and we owe it to them to put politics aside and get back to work.Republican Mike Enzi represents Wyoming in the United States Senate where he serves as chairman of the Budget Committee."foxnews,Hot Hollywood mamas,"Kourtney was proud of her 33 pound post-baby weight loss when she had Mason.

On the West Coast, the naÃ¯ve complacency that â€œit canâ€™t happen hereâ€ù abruptly rotated to the frenzied fear that â€œit can happen here, and it can happen at any moment!â€ùIn his new book, ""Panic on the Pacific: How America Prepared for a West Coast Invasion,"" noted historian and author Bill Yenne returns to the dark and fearful early months of World War II to examine the reaction of the people, the politicians, and the military to what was genuinely perceived as an immediate threat of a full-scale Japanese invasion. Here are seven things that you may not know happened on the West Coast after the Pearl Harbor attacks.1. On December 7, the Japanese almost burned down their consulate in San Francisco.At the Japanese Consulate on Jackson Street, Consul General Yoshio Muto and his secretary, Kazuyoshi Inagaki, were taken by surprise with the news that Pearl Harbor had been attackedâ€” just like everyone else in the city.Their reaction was to get rid of all their sensitive files. They became so consumed with shoveling paperwork into the big fireplace, that the flames got out of control and almost consumed the sprawling mansion. The fire department had to be called.2. General John DeWitt, the West Coast Army commander, grew so paranoid that he cancelled the Rose Bowl.Being deathly afraid of a Japanese attack on the West Coast at any moment, the commander of the US Armyâ€™s Western Defense Command banned large gatherings. Among other things, DeWitt ordered that the Rose Bowl, which was always played in Pasadena, California on New Yearâ€™s Day, be cancelled.Duke University generously offered to host the game at its stadium in Durham, North Carolina. Favored by 14, the Duke Blue Devils lost a close 20-16 game to Oregon State. It was the Beaversâ€™ only Rose Bowl victory ever.3. The U.S. military had to borrow machine guns from Hollywood.On the afternoon of December 7, Fritz Dickie at Stembridge Gun Rentals in Hollywood received a phone call from the U.S. Coast Guard. Stembridge operated what was known in the trade as the â€œGun Roomâ€ù on the Paramount Pictures lot. Founded in 1920 to supply firearms to the film industry, the facility was one of the biggest private arsenals anywhere. The Coast Guard needed guns â€” especially Thompson Submachine Guns. â€œWe loaded them on trucks and, by night, the guns which had been used mostly in gangster pictures were ready for the feared Japanese invasion,â€ù Dickie recalled.4. Japanese Navy submarines did prowl the West Coast.Beginning shortly after Pearl Harbor, a flotilla of Japanese submarines attacked shipping up and down the West Coast in a reign of terror that lasted until Christmas Eve. In one instance, people on the Pacific Coast Highway in California watched the submarine I-21 attack and sink the Union Oil Company tanker SS Montebello just a short distance offshore. â€œShe upended like a giant telephone pole and slowly settled into the sea,â€ù wrote a newspaper editor who witnessed the attack.5. The West Coast actually was bombed by Japanese aircraft.The Japanese air attack feared and predicted by General DeWitt and others immediately after Pearl Harbor actually did materializeâ€” though not for ten months. In September 1942, Warrant Officer Nobuo Fujita flew two bombing missions over southwestern Oregon in a seaplane that was carried in a water tight hangar on the deck of the submarine I-25. The object was to use incendiary bombs to start forest fires. It had been a damp summer that year and the fires did not spread6. One Japanese Attack on the West Coast was a grudge match.In addition to their attacks on merchant ships, the Japanese submarines shelled the coast three times, including strikes against Estevan Point in British Columbia and Fort Stevens in Oregon.The first attack came on the evening of February 23, 1942, when Commander Kozo Nishino brought the I-17 from beneath the waves and ordered his deck gunners to begin lobbing shells at the Ellwood oil fields north of Santa Barbara, California. For Nishino, this was no random target. Before the war, he had been the captain of an oil tanker that came to load crude oil here. As he was coming ashore, he slipped and fell into a cactus. Workers on a nearby oil rig laughed at the sight of him plucking cactus spines from his posterior. Nishino swore to get even.7. The Battle of Los Angeles, called a false alarm at the time, still raises questions.On the night of February 24, 1942, after weeks of rumors of Japanese aircraft operating with impunity over the West Coast, reports deemed credible led air defense officials to order an alert.As searchlights stabbed the night sky over Southern California, hundreds of people reported seeing unidentified aircraft in the sky. Long Beach Police Chief Joseph McClelland watched nine. At the Inglewood City Hall, policemen saw over 150. Anti-iaircraft guns responded with 1,440 large shells and countless .50-caliber rounds. Because of this, no American interceptors took off to join the fray.There were dozens of reports of a large, round, slow-moving object in the sky. Some thought it to be a balloon, while others insisted it was definitely not.Future UFO enthusiasts would, and still do, focus a great deal of attention on this aspect of the nightâ€™s excitement.The next day in Washington, Secretary of War Henry Stimson confirmed that there â€œprobablyâ€ù were enemy aircraft. U.S. Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall said that â€œas many as 15 planes may have been involved.â€ù However, Navy Secretary Frank Knox announced that it was all a â€œfalse alarm.â€ù Because these conflicting initial assessments were never resolved, many people assumed that deliberate government obfuscation was in play.To this day, the Battle of Los Angeles â€œcoverâ€‘upâ€ù still draws its own cadre of true believers whenever conspiracy theorists congregate.Bill Yenne is the author of the recently released Panic on the Pacific, as well as more than three dozen other non fiction books, mainly on historical topics.

Metro.Though the ice-age fossils (whose exact age has not yet been determined) are certainly treasures that are rarer to unearth under the subway than rat ""fossils"" and ""coprolites,"" old chicken wings or discarded coffee cups, the finds actually aren't all that surprising. The area around the site of the fossil discovery, near the La Brea/Wilshire station, is not too far from the La Brea Tar Pits, an area of central Los Angeles where natural asphalt has been seeping up from the ground for the last 40,000 years.Over the eons, this constant ooze of asphalt has created sticky pits in valleys that would often become obscured by leaves, branches and other ground cover. As a result, unwary animals stepped into the sticky death traps. The viscous ooze trapped small animals and insects immediately, while larger beasts like mammoths sank inches into the tar, struggling to get out before becoming stuck, researchers have noted. The dead or dying animals attracted predators as well â€” some of which also became stuck in the asphalt. All told, more than 1 million fossils have been found in the tar pits, according to the La Brea Tar Pits & Museum.Mammoths and mastodons are both Proboscideans. Though both were majestically large and had shaggy coats and impressively curved tusks, mammoths are much more closely related to modern-day elephants, having arisen about 5 million years ago in Africa. By contrast, mastodons arose about 27 million to 30 million years ago.During the Pleistocene epoch, between 1.8 million and 11,700 years ago, mammoths and mastodons roamed over the part of North America that was not covered by ice sheets, including coastal California.Because of the subway line project's proximity to the La Brea Tar Pits, Metro officials were anticipating fossil finds and brought on paleontologists from the firm Cogstone to make sure that any discovery of prehistoric fossils would be safely excavated and preserved, according to the blog post. The new finds were immediately covered with plaster for preservation and sent to the nearby Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.Original article on Live Science."foxnews,Flip for these pancakes on Pancake Day,"Flip for these pancakes on Pancake DayToday is Shrove Tuesday and that means eating lots of pancakes.

So celebrate by whipping up one of these fabulous pancake creations."foxnews,Where did the names for your favorite foods come from?,"When you walk into a Burger King, you donâ€™t order a â€œhamburgerâ€ùâ€”you order a Whopper. The name was designed to â€œconvey the imagery of bigness,â€ù which, yes, it does.In the years since, itâ€™s become not just one of many burger options but a brand icon. Most menu items never reach those heights (sorry, Italian Chicken Sandwich). The ones that do become household names. In a divided America, the knowledge of the Whopper is one thing that unites us all.But a good name is hard to find. The greats are distinctive, but also descriptive; quirky, but not confusing. And the stakes are high: The right name can be the difference between a middling success and a legend. To find out how the magic happens, we talked to four major restaurant chains about how they dreamed up some of their most beloved item names.Related Image Expand / Contract (Courtesy of Dunkin Donuts)Munchkins, Dunkin' DonutsIf youâ€™ve eaten at Dunkinâ€™ in the last 40 years, or worked in an office, you are probably familiar with Munchkinsâ€”tiny balls of donut served in boxes by the dozen. They werenâ€™t always Munchkins, though. The first time they made their relatively unglamorous debut on the menu, they were simply â€œDonut Holes.â€ùThis makes sense because that is exactly what they are. â€œLike a lot of things in food, you look for ways to reduce waste,â€ù says Jeff Miller, executive chef and VP of product innovation at Dunkinâ€™ Brands. When you make ring donuts, you cut them out of the dough and pop out the centers. Usually, those bits get worked back into the dough, but someone at Dunkinâ€™â€”while there are conflicting accounts as to exactly who first had the idea, Dunkinâ€™ founder William Rosenbergâ€™s official history credits then-VP Phil Gordonâ€”had the idea to fry â€˜em up and sell â€˜em cheap. You could buy a dozen Donut Holes for what was then 19 cents, less than the price of a single donut. Immediately, they were a hit. The problem, as quickly became clear, is that they were starting to eat into the sales of actual donuts: People werenâ€™t buying them in addition to the classics, but instead of them.Still, it was obviously a good idea. Maybe it just needed a new name.And so, in the early â€˜70s, the Dunkinâ€™ marketing team landed on Munchkins, after the characters in The Wizard of Oz, because basically everyone loves The Wizard of Oz. And the name fit: as Miller points out, Munchkins (the donuts), are small and cute and eminently munchable. Dunkinâ€™ got the exclusive rights to the name for cheap. According to company lore, they did a test run of the new name in Providence: in three stores, the bite-sized pastries were sold as â€œDonut Holes;â€ù in three other stores, they made their debut as Munchkins. The Munchkins won in a landslide. The little dough balls were officially rechristened in 1972.The Fribble, Friendly'sIf â€œMunchkinâ€ù is whimsical, Fribble is whimsy times one million. If it has not yet been done, someone should definitely write a musical about it.In 1935, Curtis and Prestley Blake founded their first ice cream shop in Springfield, Massachusetts. They already had a few locations going strong when they met George Bond, who had his own a chain of ice cream shops in New Jersey: Bondâ€™s Ice Cream. The trio met up every so often, to talk shop and swap ideas.Sometime in the mid-40s, Bond got a hold of the Blake Brothers and said, ""Hey, Iâ€™ve been working on this extra thick milkshake, and Iâ€™d love for you guys to come down and see what you think of it,â€™â€ù says John Macguire, Friendlyâ€™s current President and CEO. Bondâ€™s drink was called an â€œExtra Thick Chocolate Milk Shake,â€ù because, again, thatâ€™s what it is.In a delightful twist of fate, Bond then had one of his regulars try the shake. â€œAnd the customer drank it in about two minutes flat, and he set down the glass, and he said, â€˜Wow, that was awful big, and that was awful good.â€ù And so the drink became known as the â€œAwful Awful,â€ù both at Bondâ€™s Ice Cream and Friendlyâ€™sâ€”they werenâ€™t direct competitors at the time, so why not? But by 1960, says Macguire, Friendlyâ€™s was ready to expand to New Jersey, and so they asked Bond, who owned the name, if they could keep calling the shake the Awful Awful on the menu. Bond, quite reasonably, said no.And so in 1965 the Blake brothers decided to hold an employee contest to rename the milkshake, $100 for whoever comes up with the winning name. â€œAnd three different people come back with the name Fribble,â€ù says Macguire. â€œThree different people!â€ù (Fribble is indeed a real dictionary word, meaning either â€œto fool awayâ€ù (v), or â€œa frivolous person, thing, or ideaâ€ù (n).) â€œIt was unique, it was differentiated, it had a certain whimsy to it, and when you put it with â€˜Friendlyâ€™s,â€™ it rolls of the tongue pretty nicely.â€ù The total cost of the whole naming process: $300.The Bloomin' Onion, Outback SteakhouseSometimes, it is even easier that that. Take the Bloominâ€™ Onion, an overwhelming mega-hit, known as both the number-one best-selling appetizer in American casual dining, and a 1,954 calorie nutritional disaster. (To be fair, it is meant to be shared.)To trace the origins of Americaâ€™s favorite faux-Australian onion, says Outback co-founder Tim Gannon, youâ€™ve got to go back to the beginning of the restaurant itself in 1988.Before he teamed up with Chris Sullivan and Bob Basham to get the place going, Gannon had been working in restaurants in New Orleans. â€œMy dream for Outback was to bring in the great flavors of New Orleans to a nationwide concept,â€ù he says.One might point out here that Outback is not, in fact, a New Orleans-themed restaurant, but â€œthe style of the food was bold, bold flavors,â€ù Gannon explains, â€œand we needed a theme that would match that.â€ù They wanted to do something new, something that would capture dinersâ€™ curiosity. And so they settled on Australia, which, though the first restaurant was in Tampa, Florida, made a kind of intuitive sense: â€œAustralia was very popular back thenâ€”the movie Crocodile Dundee had just come out, it was the 200th Anniversary of Australia, they had just won the big sail boat race [the 1983 Americaâ€™s Cupâ€”a big deal, if you care about boats]. There was just a lot of buzz about Australia at that time.â€ù Plus, Gannon says, Australians, as a group, have a reputation for boldness.Once the team had the vision down, he says, â€œeverything else flowed.â€ù Gannon had been doing an early version of the onion back in New Orleans, inspired by vegetables carved into flowers that heâ€™d seen in a Japanese cookbook. From the get-go, Sullivan knew he wanted a zingier version of it on the menu.â€œSo we created this new onion with new flavor profiles,â€ù Gannon explains, â€œand Chris said, â€˜letâ€™s call it a Bloominâ€™ Onion, and take off the â€˜Gâ€™ to have fun. Because they use â€˜Bloominâ€™â€”thatâ€™s a great expression from Australians.â€ù It really is: these days, Gannon says, theyâ€™re selling a bloominâ€™ 17 million onions a year.CrunchWrap Supreme, Taco BellThat was in 1988. These days, the process is rarely so simple, thanks in large part to increasingly sophisticated market testing. Take, for example, the notably more scientific origins of the CrunchWrap Supreme.Taco Bell at #The90 is open late! #CrunchwrapSupreme pic.twitter.com/QdpprHQKoA â€” UK Dining (@UKyDining) November 20, 2016In 2005, Taco Bell began experimenting with a tortilla-wrapped hard-shell taco. The Food Innovation and marketing teams had been hearing from customers that tacos were too hard to eat on the go; tacos may be a perfect food, but itâ€™s difficult to eat while driving. Then genius struck: what if the tacos were also swaddled in a soft tortilla?The question was what to call it. â€œWe were playing with the fact that itâ€™s almost eaten like a sandwich,â€ù says Melissa Friebe, VP of Taco Bellâ€™s Insights Lab, â€œso we called it a CrunchWich.â€ù But during testing, consumers didnâ€™t feel â€œwichâ€ù was suitably on-brand. â€œThey said, â€˜youâ€™re not sandwiches, you guys are Mexican. Itâ€™s a wrap!â€ù CrunchWrap it was.A good name, Friebe says, has to fit with what consumers expect from Taco Bellâ€”that was the problem with the too-sandwichy CrunchWichâ€”but it also has to be delight the consumer in new and unexpected ways. â€œItâ€™s always a balance between coming up with a name that drives curiosity and interest, but also fits what the product is.â€ù Itâ€™s a science, finding that sweet spot: it takes lots of people and rounds upon rounds of testing and consumer feedback. Research, surveys, tastings, market testing. When the success of the worldâ€™s foremost portable taco is on the line, you donâ€™t leave it to chance.Sure, there will always be â€œcheeseburgersâ€ù and â€œhamburgersâ€ù and â€œshort stacksâ€ù of â€œpancakes.â€ù But the next time youâ€™re studying a menu and you see that telling little Â® sign, breathe deep, and appreciate the artistry before you. That Chocolate Thunder from Down Under didnâ€™t name itself."foxnews,Former Eagle Scout set to be executed for Alabama killing,"An Alabama man convicted of killing a store clerk is scheduled to be executed Thursday, but lawyers for the former Eagle Scout are urging it be blocked because a judge overrode a jury recommendation in imposing the death sentence.Forty-five-year-old Ronald Bert Smith, Jr., is set to receive a lethal injection at 6 p.m. CST Thursday for the Nov. 8, 1994, shooting death of Huntsville store clerk Casey Wilson. It would be Alabama's second execution this year if carried out.Lawyers for Smith and the state submitted a flurry of last court filings to the state over whether a judge should have sentenced Smith to death when a jury recommended life imprisonment. Smith's attorneys have urged the U.S. Supreme Court to block the planned execution to review the judge's override.A jury convicted Smith of capital murder in 1995 and recommended life imprisonment by a 7-5 vote, but the judge sentenced Smith to death.""Alabama is alone among the states in allowing a judge to sentence someone to death based on judicial fact finding contrary to a jury's verdict,"" attorneys for Smith wrote Wednesday. ""There is a societal consensus, and Alabama is on the wrong side of it.""Lawyers for the state argued in a court filing Tuesday that the sentence was legally sound, and that it is appropriate for judges to make the sentencing decision.""A juror's sentencing decision is likely to be the only decision about criminal punishment he or she will ever make, and it will come at the end of an emotionally draining trial, which will often be the first and only such trial a juror will have seen,"" lawyers for the state wrote.Wilson was pistol-whipped and then shot through the head during the robbery, court documents show. Surveillance video showed Smith entering the store and recovering spent shell casings from the bathroom where Wilson was shot, according to the record.Smith became an Eagle Scout at 15 and was the son of a NASA contract employee. Despite that promising start, he had an abusive home environment and struggled with alcohol dependence, downing a pint of vodka at a time in his freshman year in college and living in a ""haze"" of alcohol when the killing occurred, his attorneys wrote the governor in a clemency petition.In that petition, Smith's attorneys included an affidavit from a juror who said she believed life imprisonment was the appropriate punishment.The governor's office has declined comment on the petition.Judge Lynwood Smith, now a federal judge, sentenced Smith to death. He likened the killing to an execution, saying the store clerk was beaten into submission and shot in the head in a crime that left an infant fatherless. In overriding the jury's recommendation, the judge also noted in court records that, unlike many other criminal court defendants, Ronald Smith came from a middle-class background that afforded him opportunities.Alabama has been attempting to resume executions after a lull caused by a shortage of execution drugs and litigation over the drugs used.The state executed Christopher Eugene Brooks in January for the 1993 rape and beating death of a woman. It was the state's first execution since 2013. Judges stayed two other executions that had been scheduled this year."foxnews,Fmr Texans Wideout Takes Kids on a $20K Christmas Shopping Spree,foxnews,AP Explains: What next after the downfall of IS in Sirte?,"The Islamic State group this week lost the city of Sirte, its only foothold in Libya, essentially ending its ambition to expand its self-styled ""caliphate"" into the North African nation, at least for now.But that victory only opens the door for Libya's multiple armed factions to turn on each other in a new showdown. It could be over control of oil, the North African nation's only real source of revenue.A U.N.-brokered peace deal was reached a year ago, trying to establish a unity government to end the chaos that has plagued Libya since the ouster and death of longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi in a 2011 civil war. Instead, the country remains divided roughly between east and west, there is still no effective government and rival factions and militias â€” each side with backing from foreign countries â€” threaten a new chapter of violence.Here are some issues at stake:THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP'S FATEThe loss of Sirte, on Libya's long Mediterranean coast, is a significant reversal of how things looked in the summer of 2015 when IS took the city. With Libya in chaos, it appeared there was nothing to stop the group from expanding and building a stronghold just across the Mediterranean Sea from Europe.The militants imposed a brutal rule in Sirte much like in Iraq and Syria, committing out atrocities, taking sex slaves and carrying out beheadings of Christians and migrants. Militants affiliated to al-Qaida and other groups rebranded themselves with the IS affiliate to gain power and resources.The neighboring city of Misrata, home to some of Libya's strongest militias, led the fight to drive out IS, feeling threatened by the extremists next door. Misrata militias launched an offensive and in August the United States joined in with airstrikes. In months of tough fighting, more than 700 Misrata fighters were killed and 3,200 were wounded. This week, the last IS positions were taken.However, many of the estimated 2,500 militants likely escaped. The Misrata-led forces have not said how many were killed.It is feared that potentially hundreds of IS fighters will find refuge in Libya's lawless south and regroup, able to carry out attacks and re-emerge as player at any time. Al-Qaida-linked extremists already have bases in Libya's vast desert regions, building ties with local tribes.EAST VS WESTWith IS out of the way for the moment, Libya's rival domestic powers are face to face with each other.The powerhouse in the east is Field Marshal Khalifa Hifter, who commands the Libyan National Army, composed of Gadhafi-era officers, remains of the national military and civilians-turned-fighters. The force is backed and armed by neighboring Egypt, which sees Hifter as its ally in a fight against Islamic militants.Hifter's army backs Libya's last elected parliament, which was driven out of Tripoli in 2015 when Islamist-leaning militias and the Misrata militias took over the capital in a blitz. The parliament is now based in the eastern city of Tobruk, and the interim government based on it is in the nearby city of Beida.After two years of fighting, Hifter's forces are nearing victory over Islamic militants in Benghazi, Libya's second largest city. The militants, under an umbrella group called the Benghazi Shura Council, were allied with Islamic State group fighters in the eastern city, along with fighters from Ansar al-Shariah, the al-Qaida-affiliated group blamed in the deadly 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi.In the west, Hifter's strongest rivals are the militias of Misrata, where the general is seen as aspiring to become another Gadhafi. The Misrata militias are believed to receive arms from Turkey.Who rules in the west? It's complicated.The U.N.-brokered peace deal created a Presidency Council, a unity government and an advisory body called the Advisory Council. The Presidency Council's head, Fayed Serraj, arrived in Tripoli in March and are now the internationally recognized authority in Libya. The Misrata militias nominally back the council.But the council has little power. The Tobruk parliament refused to endorse the peace deal because it would give the Presidency Council control over the army, effectively squeezing out Hifter.So local militias hold sway across the west. And there is another rival claimant in Tripoli, the so-called National Salvation Government, headed by Khalifa Ghweil. It is rooted in a former Islamist-dominated parliament, whose allied militias took over the capital in 2014.THE OILThis is the prize Hifter and the Misrata militias may battle for.Hifter currently holds it. A few months ago, his forces took over oil terminals in the east, driving out a militia led by a commander named Ibrahim Jedran. Jedran's fighters and some anti-Hifter Benghazi militias have been trying unsuccessfully to take the facility back.The capture gave Hifter considerable leverage. Libya's Gadhafi-era production reached 1.6 million barrels a day, but in the post- 2011 chaos it collapsed, costing it more than $100 billion in lost profits the past three years. The industry is rebuilding, now producing 600,000 barrels a day and aiming to rapidly increase.The United States and U.N. have called on Hifter to hand over the facilities to the Presidency Council.But Hifter is more likely to use them as leverage to force a rewriting of the peace deal.The fear is that the fighting between Jedran and Hifter will escalate, prompting the Misrata militias to join the fight. Or Misrata could lose patience and attack its rival Hifter on its own.THE PEACE DEALUnder the peace deal, Libya was supposed to have had a unity government in place the past year with all the militias grouped under a single national command. By now, the country was supposed to be virtually finished with writing a new constitution.Instead, Serraj and his authorites are maneuvering to try to gather at least some powers. They had to strike deals with Tripoli militias just to leave the naval base where they first arrived and move into offices. The Central Bank, following the Tobruk parliament's lead, largely refuses to give him funds. As a result, the council has few tools to deal with electricity and water shortages.The Tobruk parliament demands the peace deal be reworked to alter the makeup of the Presidential Council and keep the military under its â€” and therefore Hifter's â€” authority. The Misrata militias and others in the west reject the idea of Hifter dominating the armed forces.Unless one side backs down, the country risks an explosive fight.The International Crisis Group said in a recent report that the deal is unworkable and advised, ""Time to reset.""On Tuesday before the U.N. Security Council, Martin Kobler, the U.N. envoy to Libya, said there is no alternative to the peace deal. ""It's the only workable framework.""But, he added, ""its articles are not set in stone."""foxnews,"Trump Poised to Tap John Kelly for DHS, Adding Another General to Team","Published December 07, 2016 | FoxNews.comAdding yet another general to his administration, President-elect Donald Trump is expected to tap retired Marine Gen. John Kelly as his choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security, Fox News has learned.Kelly would be the third general Trump has picked for his administration, after announcing James Mattis â€“ who along with Kelly is a four-star general -- as his pick for Defense secretary. Trump also announced in November that retired Gen. Michael Flynn would be his national security adviser.Kelly retired from the Marine Corps earlier this year after leading U.S. Southern Command for three years, during which he was involved in the oversight of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay and the southern border.Kelly was picked by Defense Secretary Robert Gates to serve as his senior military adviser and then served in the same position under Leon Panetta before moving to Southern Command.Kelly complained at his last Pentagon press conference in January that after 40 years as a Marine he had the authority to watch drug dealers heading to the border by sea, but he could not disrupt them. He is believed to have a good relationship with current DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson, with whom he served as Pentagon general counsel.He served three tours in Iraq, and holds the somber distinction of being the most senior military officer to lose a child in combat in Iraq or Afghanistan. His son, Marine 2nd Lt. Robert Kelly was killed in November, 2010, in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.Known as an outspoken but loyal commander, Kelly will be first to lead the department who is not a lawyer and the fifth overall. The department was formed after the 9/11 terror attacks in order to help foil future attacks on the American homeland.Sources say Trump has settled on Kelly for the role, and is expected to name him in the next few days. Kellyâ€™s selection will require confirmation by the Senate.Immigration enforcement is a familiar issue for Kelly, and a big part of the DHS portfolio. Southern Command, which is based in South Florida, regularly works with DHS on missions to identify and dismantle immigrant smuggling networks. And it has partnered with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in an operation targeting human smuggling into the U.S. and helped with the rescue of children arriving alone at U.S. borders.While Trump has tapped military officials for key appointments, doing so can also bring complications. Gen. Mattis will need to secure a waiver from Congress in order to be considered due to a requirement that military officials be out of service for seven years before being secretary of Defense."foxnews,FOX NEWS CO-PRESIDENTS JACK ABERNETHY AND BILL SHINE SIGN NEW MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS â€“ Fox News Channel Press,"NEW YORK â€“ September 14, 2016 â€“ FOX News co-presidents Jack Abernethy and Bill Shine have signed new multi-year contracts, announced Rupert Murdoch, Executive Chairman of 21st Century Fox and Executive Chairman of FOX News & FOX Business Network.In making the announcement, Murdoch said, â€œJack and Bill have been instrumental in FOX Newsâ€™ continued dominance in the ratings and historic earnings performance.

The survey from Bloomberg pollster Ann Selzer shows that 37 percent of adults believe the country is on the right track.â€œBig whoop,â€ù you say. But it hasnâ€™t been that high in almost four years. More significantly, only 49 percent say the country is on the wrong track, the lowest in the more than seven years of the pollâ€™s history.That can be attributed to two factors: happy Republicans and a record high in those withholding judgment: 14 percent.In the days that followed the election, there was much anxiety in Washington about â€œnormalizingâ€ù Trump. President Obama even came under criticism for his gracious welcome of the president-elect at the White House. Trump should be shunned, said the critics.Ha!Trump cards a 50 percent favorability rating in the Bloomberg poll, a 17-point jump since August. His unfavorable rating has improved by 20 points. Trump is still not as popular as Obama, who comes in at 56 percent. But Trump is doing pretty well for a guy who won with a popular vote minority and the lowest favorables of any winning nominee in the history of polling.(Speaking of minority presidents, the Electoral College is one of the big losers in the poll, with just 41 percent saying the Framersâ€™ system is still the best way to pick the president.)On Trumpâ€™s agenda items there is optimism, too.A narrow majority approves of most of Trumpâ€™s cabinet picks. And a jaw-dropping 73 percent were unfazed by Trumpâ€™s shifting stances on key issues like prosecuting Hillary Clinton, banning Muslims from entering the United States or retaining portions of ObamaCare.In all, 55 percent of respondents said they were more optimistic about his presidency based on what theyâ€™d seen from him in the month since the vote.Trump knows what voters like: jobs. Symbolic moves like saving hundreds of jobs at Carrier, a heating and air conditioning plant, are paying off. Some 54 percent of respondents said Trump would do better on jobs and employment than Obama. Half said Trump would do better at dealing with Wall Street.Trumpâ€™s only real substantial deficit to Obama was on foreign policy, where just 40 percent think heâ€™ll do better than the current commander-in-chief. That puts a little extra pepper on the secretary of state choice.A cursory reading of the poll says that Trump has little to worry about conflicts of interest with 69 percent saying it would go too far for Trump to sell his businesses so neither he nor his family could profit from his actions.He does have to bear in mind the 67 percent of respondents who believe Trump needs to choose between â€œbeing president and being a businessman, to avoid the appearance of a conflict.â€ù But so far, so good.There are clouds are on the horizon for Trump, though.The essential challenge is this: Itâ€™s a lot easier to be popular when you are still in the skywriting phase of an administration. Trump will soon shift to a chisel on granite as he carves his policy proscriptions.Each day brings news discomfiting to some segment of Trumpâ€™s supporters. Monday, it was Al Gore hanging out at Trump Tower. Tuesday, it was free-marketers worried about Trump picking winners and losers. Today, itâ€™s new suggestions of leniency for illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.How much will Trump chase favorability ratings with popular positions? How much will he stick with his base? Itâ€™s tricky business for any president.Having broad support is good, but itâ€™s usually shallow and prone to evaporate in the first drought. Having deep support is also great. But if you stay down there too long, you get bends when you try to be on the surface. Neither a lungfish nor an anglerfish be.In this moment, though, Trump is the beneficiary of what few wouldâ€™ve predicted in the dark, rancorous days after the election: an undeniable win bonus.THE RULEBOOK: A NICE LITTLE MIXâ€œThe proposed Constitution, therefore, is, in strictness, neither a national nor a federal Constitution, but a composition of both.â€ù â€“ Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 39TIME OUT: STILL A MYSTERYOn todayâ€™s 75th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack, author Craig Nelson recalls one of the remaining mysteries surrounding the attack concerning an ad for a dice game in the New Yorker with the pitch that the game was meant to pass time while people took shelter during an air raid.

In his Time â€œPerson of the Yearâ€ù interview released Wednesday, Trump didn't back down from his promise to end Obama's executive orders on immigration, but he did offer an opening for people who qualified for Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. â€˜Weâ€™re going to work something out thatâ€™s going to make people happy and proud,â€™ Trump said. â€˜They got brought here at a very young age, theyâ€™ve worked here, theyâ€™ve gone to school here. Some were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And theyâ€™re in never-never land because they donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going to happen.â€™â€ùKELLY TO GET NOD FOR HOMELAND SECRETARYNY Post: â€œDonald Trump plans to name a third retired general to a top national security spot, according to a new report. Retired Gen. John Kelly is the president-electâ€™s pick to be the next secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, CBS said Wednesday. Retired Gen. Jim Mattis was officially named Tuesday night to be the next secretary of defense. And retired Gen. Michael Flynn will serve as the presidentâ€™s national security adviser. Kelly, a Marine, served most recently as head of US Southern Command. He left the military earlier this year. If confirmed by the Senate, Kelly will succeed President Obamaâ€™s appointee, Jeh Johnson.â€ùDRUG STOCKS TUMBLE AFTER TRUMP WARNINGReuters: â€œShares of U.S. pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies tumbled on Wednesday after President-elect Donald Trump said he would ""bring down drug prices."" In a cover article for Time magazine, which named Trump as Person of the Year, he said ""I don't like what has happened with drug prices."" Investors initially hailed Trump's victory as a boon for drug and biotech stocks, with the Nasdaq Biotech Index up as much as 12 percent in the two days after the Nov. 8 election. Investors were relieved that Trump's rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, who had been critical of rising drug prices during the campaign, had not won the White House.â€ùSPENDING BILL ROLLS ON AHEAD OF FRIDAY DEADLINERoll Call: â€œCongressional negotiators released a stopgap spending bill Tuesday night to avert a partial government shutdown at midnight Friday and to fund federal agencies and programs through April 28â€_ The measure includes $170 million in aid to rebuild water systems in Flint, Michigan, following a lead poisoning crisis, plus a boost of roughly $10.1 billion in uncapped war funds, divided between the Pentagon and the State Department.

Perhaps you could come up with some examples. And please, please, please donâ€™t claim â€˜tax expendituresâ€™ as spending.â€ù â€“ Pat Conroy, Austin, Texas[Ed. note: Well, maybe I am missing the point here, but I think that there are a lot of self-styled conservatives who want to see domestic spending increase. Donald Trump, I assume, considers himself a conservative. One of the core parts of his platform is to stop spending money overseas and start spending on â€œnation buildingâ€ù here at home. One of the agenda items for the president-electâ€™s first hundred days is a domestic infrastructure package of about $1 trillion paid for with deficit spending. Itâ€™s an investment Trump says will pay off in future years compensating for excess outlays now. For many, economic nationalism involves spending more money, at least at first, on America.]â€œAnother home run on your analysis of Trump versus conservative ideologues! For three decades, and either out of misplaced good intentions or corruption, conservatives and liberals have incentivized the export of jobs overseasâ€_Trump's pressure on American companies is a bailout for the American worker in an attempt to reverse the liberal-conservative excesses of the past 30 yearsâ€_American workers are ready to march for Trump in opposition to Ivory Tower intellectuals opposed to his actions on their behalf. Again, Bravo for your analysis.â€ù â€“ Eric Hutchins, Santa Barbara, Calif.[Ed. note: Arguably Trumpâ€™s best sales pitch in the election was â€œI will be your voice.â€ù For millions of Americans who have felt taken advantage of or victimized by a system â€œriggedâ€ù in favor of elites, it was refreshing and empowering to feel understood. The test now for Trump is to deliver results. The approach seems to be to establish a government that reflects many parts of the status quo, but allow Trump himself to be the change agent or even provocateur: a conservative ideological government, with a post-ideological president. If wages rise across the board, Trump will be heralded as a great president. If they remain stagnant or fall, he will be judged a disaster. Political pragmatism is judged on a strictly pass-fail basis.]Share your color commentary: Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM and please make sure to include your name and hometown.HO, HO, HOWBOC: â€œHARBESON, Del. - The owner of an adult store in Harbeson is offering a way for families to take photos with Santa free of charge during the holidays.

In the incident, captured on video, the TSA agent then goes back up and repeated the process along Albertâ€™s right leg.But when the agent moved her hands to her chest, Albert, co-host of a media company called â€œThe Moms,â€ù had had enough.â€œYou can't touch me there,â€ù she told the agent. â€œYou canâ€™t touch me there ...

Plus, none of these will break the bank.Please note: Iâ€™m not endorsing any specific product or brand, just showcasing some of my favorites from around the web.Under $100TSA PreCheck: At $85, this is one of the more expensive items on the list but PreCheck is good for five years and pays for itself in convenience almost immediately thanks to the quick, dedicated airport security lanes which allow travelers to keep shoes and jackets on, toiletries in bags and laptops in cases. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on signing up and going through the interview/fingerprinting process (which literally takes just a few minutes).Add to the gift by offering to drive the recipient to the interview site.Under $75Carry-on bag: You could spend about $1,400 on a handsome Tumi spinner but if thatâ€™s not what you want, donâ€™t worry-- major department stores and online vendors have lots of bags in the $40 to $75 range, including Macyâ€™s. Or do what one of my employees did, buy an un-wheeled duffel-type bag at a discount place like Ross: â€œI only paid $30, and it was perfect during my ten day trip to Europe.â€ù On domestic flights, carry-on bags pay for themselves almost immediately since checked-bag fees typically cost $50 round-trip.But what if your airline also charges for carry-ons? Smaller bags have other benefits: Airlines canâ€™t lose a bag that travels by your side, plus you get in and out of the airport much faster.Under $50Airline gift card: If you know your loved one has a favorite airline (or just has access to a very few at their smallish, hometown airport), give them an airline gift card. Southwest offers cards ranging from $10 to $1,000 while Deltaâ€™s start at $50 to $1,000. American Airlines offers gift cards ranging from $50 to $1,500 and you can choose to send a plastic card in the mail or a virtual card via email.Not all airlines offer gift cards, but itâ€™s easy to figure out which do by searching the site for ""gift card.""Under $25Hand-held luggage scale: A nifty gift for the over-packer in your life thanks to overweight baggage fees, which can run as high as $200 each-way (and thatâ€™s on top of the regular checked-bag fee). Know your airlineâ€™s weight limit-- it varies but you're usually allowed up to 50 lbs. A simple hand-held luggage scale only costs about $10 to $20 but can save ten times that much.Find them on Amazon, Google, Target, your local luggage or hardware store.Refillable water bottle: Donâ€™t pay airport prices for a bottle of water and donâ€™t bring one that will just be dumped by security agents. Bring an empty bottle and fill it up at a drinking fountain or one of the many designated water refill stations at airports (find them in Atlanta, Boston, Denver, San Francisco and many more).Water bottles are available pretty much everywhere. Bed, Bath and Beyond has hardy ones for around $15 or go super-deluxe with a stainless steel model that can be found at any camping goods type store. Those can run up to $40.Rick Seaney is an airline travel expert and the co-founder of FareCompare.com, an airfare comparison shopping site"foxnews,Prison for Michigan man accused of wanting to fight in Syria,"A Detroit-area man accused of trying to travel to the Middle East to fight in Syria's civil war has been sentenced to five years in prison.Mohammad Hamdan has been in custody for nearly three years and will get credit for that time. He was sentenced Wednesday, about four months after pleading guilty to making false statements to agents.The government says the 24-year-old Hamdan wanted to join Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim group in Lebanon that is classified by the U.S. as a terrorist organization.He was arrested in 2014 prior to boarding a flight at Detroit Metropolitan Airport. Hamdan is a native of Lebanon. He says he won't oppose an effort to deport him there after his prison sentence."foxnews,"Standing Rock protesters stay put despite victory, elements","Pipeline protesters in North Dakota are either too afraid their hard fought victory will slip away or are having too much of an experience to disperse, and it may take plunging temperatures and disease to dislodge them from their camp at Standing Rock.Drumming, sacred blessings and cries of joy have echoed from the assembled throng of Sioux Indians, environmentalists, civil rights and water-worried protesters after the weekend announcement that U.S. Army Corps of Engineers struck down plans for the controversial Dakota Access pipeline.Related Image Expand / Contract Thousands remain encamped despite bitter cold and deteriorating conditions. (Special to FoxNews.com)The tube, which is nearly complete, was to extend under a section of the Missouri River that the Standing Rock Sioux consider sacred ground, even though it is not on their reservation. With temperatures diving, and the lack of sanitation taking its toll, it may seem thereâ€™s nothing left to fight â€“ or celebrate. But even though some of the less hardy have gone their separate ways, tribal elders vowed this week that it is an â€œabsoluteâ€ù they will remain.â€œThe greater fight is the corporations raping the earth,â€ù Margaret Engle Reyes, an activist who traveled to the camp last week, told FoxNews.com. â€œThat is the real fight and will continue. People here are used to bad snow conditions and are hunkered down. Some of the California hippie types might not stay.â€ùProtesters fear the victory â€“ which comes in the twilight days of the Obama administration â€“ is fragile. President-elect Donald Trump has the power to overturn the decision when he takes office next month, and has vowed to make energy independence a top priority.Related Image Expand / Contract Shelter is scarce, and some of the locals resent outsiders, sources said. (Special to FoxNews.com)The $3.8 billion, 1,170-mile natural gas pipeline proposed and mostly completed by Energy Transfer Partners is slated to carry around 470,000 barrels of domestic crude oil per day from North Dakota to Illinois. The company claims it will be far safer and more cost effective than moving oil by rail, and officials emphasize that the project is not on reservation, but rather privately-owned land.James Reese, founder of private security firm Tiger Swan, which was hired by Energy Transfer to protect private property in early September, told FoxNews.com that law enforcement has any potential flare-ups â€œunder control,â€ù and that his battery of personnel â€“ made up mostly of Special Operations veterans â€“ will â€œcontinue to sit and make sure the equipment and private property is safe.â€ùHe is betting that his men can outlast at least most of the protesters.â€œOur assessment is that many will leave,â€ù Reese continued. â€œBut there will still be a hardcore element that will stay on and protest.â€ùA spokesperson for the Tribal Council at Standing Rock did not respond to a request for comment. At the sprawling camp, where thousands remain, there are growing concerns over health and safety. Undercover officers patrolling the camps cited overflowing toilets, bad cases of diarrhea and the spread of bronchial problems.â€œDemonstrators are having issues with pink eye, strep and pneumonias,â€ù another source on the ground said. â€œThey arenâ€™t showering for five or six days, many are sharing beds. Itâ€™s going to happen.â€ùSeveral sources cited increasing friction among the demonstrators, telling FoxNews.com that this week there has been quarrelling over supplies, huts being taken over by non-locals and a rift among leadership over whether the outside supporters are even welcome. One protester said the donations from around the nation have dried up, the vets who came have abandoned their leadership and there is a genuine fear people will die.â€œThere is some discontent between factions in the camps, and the weather is brutal,â€ù Reese said. â€œPeople are trying to sleep in cars, and carbon monoxide poisoning is a concern. There are over 100 vehicles in snow banks crashed on the side of the road. People are trying to leave but donâ€™t know where to go. Visibility is about 50 feet. If you arenâ€™t ready for this environment, you will die.â€ùRob Keller, spokesman for the Morton County Sheriffâ€™s Department, said that they have opened up a community center and schools in the area for demonstrators to seek shelter, and highlighted that the weather has made this a â€œlife or death situation.â€ù Keller noted that there was little logic or reason for people to remain in the camps, but said they would not forcibly remove people. Yet many demonstrators insisted that the bigger fight remains as firm as ever, claiming that the construction is only temporarily halted, and that the drilling will go on.â€œThis fight will end when we see the end of the outdated fossil fuel era, when this greed and destruction has been replaced by the sanity of sustainable systems that honor our earth and its people,â€ù stressed activist Nicole Fantl.If the elements, supplies and health risks werenâ€™t enough, there is always the danger violence could break out between law enforcement and demonstrators.â€œYou can still do security and you can be nice. But when they start throwing stones and rolling propane bombs at you, it is not being nice anymore,â€ù Reese said. â€œWe are outnumbered thousands to one. The law enforcement is outnumbered hundreds to one. It is a small law enforcement [presence] here and they are tapped out, these protesters are taking away other officers from their community. The locals are tired, their livestock is missing. This has been going on for months.â€ùLaw enforcement has characterized the protest as lawless, and more than 400 have been arrested. While most of the protesting is taking place in North Dakota, security and intelligence personnel did span South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois over steep concerns that the situation will spill over.Several sources also told FoxNews.com that protesters threatened the lives of employees and other figures connected to Energy Transfer Partners in Texas, which in recent weeks became a point of great concern for them and their families, some of who consulted private guard firms.However, protesters have vehemently denied unlawful behavior and paint a very different picture.â€œIt is a peaceful prayer camp and people adhere to and respect that. The people are respectful, conscious, educated and socially aware. The water protectors are not doing anything to warrant the violence against them,â€ù protester and filmmaker Elias Matar, 52, said, before hinting that some were concerned their electronic devices were hacked and tapped. â€œThere have been frequent incidents of phones displaying strange behavior.â€ùJamie Brennan contributed to this report"foxnews,Watch Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network Online,foxnews,"Mariah Carey claims she only eats one thing all day, everyday","There's something pretty fishy about Mariah Carey's strict new diet regimen.

In one of the unexpected upsets in modern history, Donald Trump is going to be the next president of the United States. In some ways, this result is the fulfillment of the political discontent that first began to manifest itself as the Tea Party in 2008, a desire for something more than business as usual. But as we enter 2017, itâ€™s clear that we are more divided than ever, with no clear path forward getting to more prosperity and freedom for all Americans.People are protesting in the streets, theyâ€™re setting things on fire, the #NotMyPresident hashtag is trending on Twitter. This is not what a healthy democracy looks like.Iâ€™m not suggesting that those who fear Trump just suck it up and embrace him, but the violence doesn't help your cause.It's important to understand that Trump is a symptom -- not of a country that is inherently racist, sexist, or bigoted, as some have claimed -- but of a political system that just doesnâ€™t work in a world where everyone is freer to think outside the establishment's box.One good thing we can take away from this cycle is the indisputable realization that our political system is badly behind the curve of technology driven disintermediation. What is it that alcoholics are told? The first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem.Democratic voters who preferred Bernie Sanders to Hillary Clinton were denied a voice by rigid party control and superdelegates. They feel disenfranchised, like their vote doesnâ€™t matter, so much so that Iâ€™m willing to bet a fair number of them ended up supporting Trump over Hillary. Trump voters were tired of nominating the same recycled Republicans who talk a good game, but ultimately fall down when it matters (see Bob Dole, John McCain, and Mitt Romney). Both parties failed the people who have supported them through the years.Enter Donald Trump.But the problem is a deeper one than the way the parties are run. Itâ€™s the fact that weâ€™re stuck with just two parties in the first place. By all accounts, both Trump and Clinton were the least popular presidential nominees there have ever been. And yet many voters felt forced to vote for one of them. This lack of enthusiasm ultimately cost Clinton the election.This is partially due to fear â€” fear that the candidate you despise might win if you donâ€™t vote for the one you merely hate.How can we get better choices later if we are stuck not making a third choice now? We should consider looking at reforms like Rank Choice Voting, an alternative to the current â€œfirst past the postâ€ù voting system, that might enfranchise more, and better, alternative candidates.Part of it is habit. Itâ€™s easy to pick a team, red or blue, and simply vote down the line every election. How can we make it easier for busy people to get better information? This barrier is a tougher one to overcome, and requires continuous educational efforts, particularly aimed toward young people.But a major reason why we are repeatedly forced to choose between the lesser of two evils is that the system is designed in such a way as to make it almost impossible for anyone else to gain national recognition as a serious candidate.The Commission on Presidential Debates, an organization run by professional Democrats and Republicans, studiously devises rules that keep third parties off the main stage. Itâ€™s a cartel. Itâ€™s also a frustrating Catch-22. People have to know who you are before you can get on the presidential stage and show them who you are.People know theyâ€™re unhappy with the choices theyâ€™ve been given. But technology and easy access to new information means that we donâ€™t have to do as weâ€™re told anymore.Itâ€™s Ok to color outside the lines. Itâ€™s better than OK, in fact. Itâ€™s downright American.Things can change, but only if we demand that they do. Itâ€™s up to us to build something that empowers the people from the ground up.Top down control is steadily being toppled in every aspect of our culture due to disruptive technology and the new ways young people consume information. One size fits all politics may be the last one to fall, but fall it will, and weâ€™ll be better off for it.Iâ€™ve always said that politics is a lagging indicator of culture. Upstream of politics, our culture is free to choose, iconoclastic and entrepreneurial.I canâ€™t wait for the day when our politics reflects the rest of our world.Matt Kibbe is president and chief community organizer of Free the People.

This week, researchers in Scotland unveiled the fossilized skeleton of â€œthe Storr Lochs Monsterâ€ùâ€“ a Jurassicâ€“era predator known as an ichthyosaur that roamed the oceans 170 million years ago.Itâ€™s the most complete skeleton of a prehistoric sea reptile ever found in Scotland and is being hailed as the â€œcrown jewelâ€ù of Scottish fossils.The story of the skeletonâ€™s discovery begins in 1966 on the Isle of Skye, when an amateur fossil hunter named Norrie Gillies came upon the rockâ€“embedded bones while walking the beach near the SSE Storr Lochs Power Station he managed.â€œThey were sticking out of the rock in the tidal zone, so they would have been covered by water much of the day,â€ù Dr. Stephen Brusatte, of the University of Edinburghâ€™s School of GeoSciences, told FoxNews.com. â€œThe bones are chocolate brown and [would have stood] out from the much palerâ€“colored rock.â€ùGillies, who died in 2011, notified the local science community of his find. After unearthing the rocks, they were moved to a National Museums Scotland storage facility, where they sat for a good 50 years.â€œBack in the1960s there were two problems: the bones were in such hard rock that there wasn't the expertise to prepare them out of the rock, and there also weren't many (or any) vertebrate paleontologists in Scotland to study it,â€ù Brusatte said, regarding the long storage period. â€œThe museum did exactly what museums are supposed to do: preserve important historical and cultural specimens so they can be studied. That study doesn't always happen right after those specimens are found; sometimes it takes a little time.â€ùThat time came in the past few years, when Brusatte and other paleontologists rediscovered the skeleton and set out to finally separate bone from stone. They hired one of the world's best fossil conservators, Nigel Larkin, to free the bones from the sedimentary rock using techniques that werenâ€™t around back in the â€˜60s. With the fossil now ready for study, it only took a short while for Brusatte and his team to realize that they had a nearâ€“complete skeleton of an ichthyosaur on their hands.â€œIchthyosaurs have very distinctive bones, most notably vertebrae that look like ashtrays,â€ù Brusatte explained. â€œThat is what told us immediately that the fossil is an ichthyosaur.â€ùA cousin of the dinosaur, ichthyosaurs looked like reptile versions of dolphins with their long snouts full of tiny teeth, flippers, and streamlined bodies. The Storr Lochs Monster would have been about 10 to 13 feet long, which Brusatte called a â€œmiddle of the road ichthyosaur,â€ù as some could get up to 15 feet or so. It would have survived on a diet of fish and squid.Now that the skeleton has been identified, Brusatte and his team plan on figuring out what species of ichthyosaur the Storr Lochs Monster is and if it can shed some light on how the dinoâ€“cousins evolved during the mysterious Middle Jurassic period. Not much is known about this particular time in history, and the Isle of Skye is currently one of the few places on Earth where Middle Jurassicâ€“era fossils can be found, a fact Brusatte attributes to luck.â€œ170 million years ago, Skye was part of a small island perched in the middle of the Atlantic,â€ù he said. â€œThere were big rivers coursing across the land, which flowed past lagoons before emptying into the sea. Lots of animals lived in these environments, and they are perfect environments for preserving rocks.

Weâ€™re hopeful that our government will make additional changes to the legal framework and market conditions in the future.â€ùâ€œReforms made by the U.S. government to allow for increased travel, telecom services and banking have helped substantially as we attempt to grow our businesses,â€ù the letter said.â€œWeâ€™re confident that you understand the importance of economic engagement between nations. Small businesses in Cuba have the potential to be drivers of economic growth in Cuba and important partners of the U.S. business community.â€ùFour entrepreneurs participated in a press conference on Wednesday in Washington, D.C., along with groups that favor lifting the U.S.-Cuba embargo.When Fidel Castro died, Trump tweeted, â€œIf Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban-American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal.â€ùThat created concern among proponents of restored diplomatic relations that Trump would undo all the changes the Obama administration undertook, by easing trade and travel restrictions.â€œAs a businessman, Mr. Trump would be proud of the entrepreneurial spirit of the Cuban people,â€ù James William, president of Engage Cuba, a national advocacy organization dedicated to dismantling the U.S. embargo on Cuba, said. â€œThese changes have helped Cuba's private sector grow and are widely supported across the island.â€ùAt the press conference Marta Elisa Deus Rodriguez, one of the entrepreneurs, said â€œI now own three businesses, and I want to grow all of them, and thatâ€™s why I hope the new administration does not change this policy.â€ùShe fears that if the policy does change, her business will suffer.Julia de la Rosa and her husband have run a bed and breakfast more than 20 years. And when the U.S. and Cuba re-established relations and Airbnb came to Cuba, their business was able to grow. They have had hundreds of visitors in the past 18 months, and increasing their staff to 17 people.â€œI hope that President elect-Trump recognizes how much these changes have helped us. We want to improve our relations with the U.S. and think about the future and what our two countries can accomplish together,â€ù de la Rosa said.According to Reuters, private businesses still have no access to wholesale stores and can only import or export goods via government agencies.Nikki Abrego is a college associate at Fox News Latino.

But the GOP hopes to widen its slim majority in the upper chamber in Louisiana on Saturday, when two finalists compete in a runoff for the open seat of retiring GOP Sen. David Vitter.A Republican win would give the party a 52-48 seat majority in the Senate next year.The contest between GOP candidate John Kennedy, the state treasurer, and Democratic opponent Foster Campbell, a state Public Service commissioner, also has emerged as a final proxy battle between the Trump campaign and supporters of failed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.State Republicans announced Wednesday that Trump, now the president-elect, will visit Baton Rouge on Friday to lead a get-out-the-vote rally for Kennedy.Kennedy leads Campbell by 14 percentage points in the runoff race, according to the most recent polling by Southern Media Opinion and Research.They enter the runoff as the top two vote-getters in the Nov. 8 general election in which nobody in the 12-person field could surpass the 50 percent threshold to win.Related Image Expand / Contract FILE - In this Nov. 2, 2016 file photo, Senate candidates, left to right, Rep. Charles Boustany, D-La., Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell, David Duke, attorney Carolyn Fayard, Rep. John Fleming, R-La., and Louisiana Treasurer John Neely Kennedy take their places before a debate at Dillard University in New Orleans. (AP)The GOP in 2016 had incumbent senators in 24 races, which gave Democrats their best opportunity in years to retake control of the chamber. But the populist wave that swept Trump into the White House also helped fellow Republicans keep their House and Senate majorities.A GOP win this weekend would be cause for a final, 2016 celebration for the party.This past weekend, Vice President-elect Mike Pence was in Louisiana trying to whip up votes for Kennedy.â€œI just hung up the phone from President-elect Trump,â€ù Pence told the crowd. â€œHe said to â€_ say how grateful he was for the support from Louisiana. He said that he has one more thing to ask, to send John Kennedy to the United States Senate.â€ùDespite having a Democratic governor, Louisiana is deep red and has voted for the GOP presidential nominee in eight of the past 10 contests, including this year when Trump decisively beat Clinton, 58-38 percent.As Pence suggested Saturday, his visit with Trump this summer to flood-ravaged Louisiana -- a trip Clinton didn't make -- only strengthened the bond between Republicans and Louisiana voters.â€œThe most inspiring day for me on the campaign was back in August,â€ù he said. â€œLouisiana, you inspired the nation. And I promise that our president-elect and I will be with you.â€ùSouthern Media pollster Bernie Pinsonat on Tuesday told FoxNews.com: â€œTrump is very popular here. The issue is very simple: Trump stomped Clinton.â€ùClinton supporters and other Democrats have tried to help Campbell, giving enough money, much of it in small-dollar donations, to essentially keep him evenly matched with Kennedy. Each has roughly $1.4 million in cash going into Saturdayâ€™s runoff, according to OpenSecrets.org.Still, Campbell faces an uphill battle in trying to erase Kennedyâ€™s 52-38 point lead with the runoff just days away.Beyond the Trump effect, Louisianaâ€™s $300 million budget deficit is a big factor in the contest.Pinsonat said Kennedy climbed to the top of the race because he was a state treasurer with the popular message that Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwardsâ€™ administration was spending too much.â€œHe had a microphone to go across the state,â€ù Pinsonat said. â€œHe was the peopleâ€™s choice on the budget.â€ùThe Southern Media poll showed voters agreed with Kennedy 54-40 percent on overspending, not Edwardsâ€™ argument that state government needs more revenue.If Campbell has one advantage compared with last month's candidates, it is that he is the only Democratic Senate contender this year who can tell voters exactly how he would deal with a new president -- since Trump has already won.""If he wants to build roads and bridges, I'm all about that,"" Campbell recently said on the ""Keepin' It 1600"" podcast. ""But if he wants to privatize Social Security and he wants to give a voucher for Medicare, I cannot support that. I'll fight that tooth and toenail."""foxnews,Fox411's snap of the day,"Fox411's snap of the dayFoxNews.comhttp://www.foxnews.com/Emily in lingerie The model took to Instagram to share a picture of herself in white lingerie.

Texas requires parents to approve immunizations, rather than mandating shots and having families opt out if they object to them.Some Texas state lawmakers said Wednesday they want to create a system where students who oppose immunizations would have to opt out of otherwise standard immunizations â€” and could only do so after watching a video on the medical effectiveness of vaccines.The most common immunizations protect against measles, mumps, and rubella, or German measles, as well as diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio and hepatitis A and B.Texas and 17 other states allow philosophical exemptions to vaccines. California used to let students forgo vaccinations for similar reasons â€” only to approve some of the country's strictest vaccine requirements last year. That law eliminated religious and personal beliefs as reasons for opting out of mandatory immunizations.The small group of Texas lawmakers that wants to make changes isn't planning to go that far when the GOP-controlled Legislature heads back into session Jan. 10.""The fact is that people have a choice to not immunize, but we need the herd effect,"" Rep. Donna Howard, an Austin Democrat who has filed an immunization ""opt-in"" bill, told reporters Wednesday. ""We need a significant number to be immunized to not only protect themselves but to protect the larger community.""Past efforts to improve immunization rates in Texas mostly have been stymied by opposition from conservative legislators who are immunizations skeptics, as well as a political group called Texans for Vaccine Choice. They point to discredited studies linking immunizations to health problems including autism.Texans for Vaccine Choice didn't respond to requests for comment Wednesday.Preparations for a legislative clash come amid a mumps outbreak south of Fort Worth, where immunization refusal rates in school districts are higher than the state average.Neighboring Arkansas has reported nearly 1,900 confirmed or suspected cases of mumps this year, though many of those involved children who got vaccines. That outbreak has nonetheless centered in an area where opt-out rates exceed those in other parts of Arkansas, according to that state's Department of Health. Like Texas, Arkansas allows parents to claim medical, religious or philosophical exemptions from school vaccination requirements.In Texas, nearly 45,000 kindergarten through 12th grade students reported filing conscientious exemptions to vaccinations last school year, which represents 0.84 percent of the number of students reported enrolled by schools in an annual survey, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. But as recently as the 2008 academic year, only about 12,600 public school students reported filing conscientious exemptions to immunizations, or 0.28 percent of that year's reported enrollment total.State Rep. Sarah Davis, a suburban Houston Republican who is sponsoring a proposal to mandate an online class for Texans who get non-medical exemptions to school immunizations, said that ""for some reason, there's a growing movement afoot to question the science and effectiveness of vaccines.""""Discredited research offered by discredited sources has nonetheless gained traction,"" Davis said Wednesday. ""It has created doubts in parents and uncertainty among the public. We're here because it's time to fight back."""foxnews,Sheriff Clarke: US Must Enforce Its Borders Under Trump,foxnews,Will Donald Trump be able to unite the country?,foxnews,Teen Idol Bobby Rydellâ€™s Long-Lasting Career Comes to Life in Latest Book,"American singer Bobby Rydellâ€™s career spans over six decades long.

A new date was set for January.Josh was scheduled for a hearing in September, and then in October, and again in November, but in every case the judge failed to appear.The courts are closed through the holidays.â€œThat will mean three years of holidays without my son,â€ù Josh's mother, Laurie MoonHolt told FNL.Holt, a former Mormon missionary traveled to Venezuela to marry a woman he met online while looking for Spanish-speaking Mormons to help him improve his Spanish. Venezuelan officials allege he was using his wife's apartment to stockpile weapons and have suggested his case is linked to other unspecified attempts by the U.S. government to undermine President Nicolas Maduro's socialist rule amid deep economic and political turbulence.The U.S. House passed a resolution in September calling for the release of Holt and other political prisoners in Venezuela. Secretary of State John Kerry raised Holt's jailing during a meeting with Maduro in September, and a senior State Department official traveled to Caracas twice in recent weeks in part to push for his release.The pressure has so far yielded no tangible results. Human rights groups contend Maduro's government is using Holt and his jailed wife, an Ecuadorian national, as bargaining chips to extract concessions from the United States.Holt is being held in a prison in Caracas run by Venezuela's intelligence police. The facility also holds a number of activists that the opposition considers political prisoners.His lawyer says that Holt has lost considerable weight and suffered from a host of ailments, including kidney stones. Holt also has allegedly had to endure harassment by prison guards who forced him to strip naked in a hallway and perform exercises.The Holts have hired a team of lawyers in an effort to get Josh and Thamara released, and kept the story alive via social media.In a letter from jail, Holt said the assault rifle and a grenade found in his wife's apartment were planted when he refused to pay police a bribe during a routine raid in the government-built housing complex where he was staying with his wife and her son.Interior Minister Gustavo Gonzalez, who oversees the intelligence police and was sanctioned by the Obama administration in 2014 for human rights abuses, has called Holt a ""trained gunman"" intent on destabilizing Venezuela.Based on reporting by the Associated Press.Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram"foxnews,1994 Heisman Trophy Winner Rashaan Salaam Found Dead,"On the day that authorities announce charges against the man who shot former NFL running back Joe McKnight to death, news that another former running back has also died.FOXâ€™s Chris Hoenig reports:1994 Heisman Trophy winner Rashaan Salaam was found dead in the parking lot of a Boulder, Colorado, park Monday night:(Cordingly) â€œAt this time, there is no indication of foul play.

Mike Enzi: My plan to put Congress on a 'diet' and fix our broken budget process,"As this year draws to a close, we are once again approaching a federal budget deadline that will likely be postponed. Over the last 40 years, since the modern budget process was established, Congress has enacted 175 temporary spending bills, formally known as â€˜continuing resolutions,â€™ to avoid doing its job. Itâ€™s time to change the way Congress does business.The November election results showed that hardworking taxpayers are eager for real change. With a new president taking office on January 20th, Congress has an opportunity â€“ and responsibility â€“ to get back to work.The first step must be fixing Americaâ€™s broken budget process to provide our nation with a responsible fiscal blueprint and help guide our spending decisions now and into the future. As chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, this will be one of my top priorities in the new congress.We are a nation on course for a fiscal disaster, because when it comes to spending money, Congress is like a binge eater. We donâ€™t want to start our diet until right AFTER the next dessert. That attitude has led to a mammoth, oversized national debt that, left unchecked, will crush the prosperity of future generations.We must start spending within our means and establish healthy fiscal habits. Unfortunately, Americaâ€™s broken budget process makes it easy for Congress to spend without ever checking its fiscal waist line.Currently, only thirty percent of the national budget is annually distributed to federal agencies and programs by Congress. This money funds the activities that most people would associate with good government, such as national defense, education, and infrastructure spending.We must pass spending bills to fund these government activities every year, forcing a public debate about where taxpayer dollars should be spent.In fact, this is the portion of the budget that attracts the most congressional scrutiny and debate, and there are limits in place that make it very difficult to spend more than whatâ€™s allotted. But it is not growing rapidly and is not the cause of our unsustainable fiscal course.The real culprit is the other seventy percent of the federal budget that is spent automatically, without regular congressional action or review.In just 15 years, it will consume ALL government revenues, as debt interest payments and entitlements continue to grow rapidly. There are no effective limits to the amount that can be spent on this side of the budget, at least until this spending drives America into bankruptcy.This is how the budget process makes it easy to spend money. There is regular review and strict limits on the small and shrinking portion of the budget. But the much larger automatic spending programs are not regularly reviewed and can grow almost without limit.To make matters worse, the historically low interest rates that America has relied on to pay its debt are poised to surge, according to the latest signals from the Federal Reserve. When these rates rise, we can expect to spend more every year on interest payments for these loans than we spend on national defense.The Senate Budget Committee has been working on reforms that would fix Americaâ€™s broken budget process. Many of these reforms strengthen the congressional budget, the only existing tool we have that forces Congress to examine all spending and revenues, including automatic spending, over a ten-year period. This budgeting process should be easier to adopt and harder to ignore. Congress can start by reducing the needless political hurdles to passing a budget and making it harder to ignore overspending once Congress agreed to it.The congressional budget is easily ignored in the Senate because it takes the same number of votes in the Senate to waive a budget violation that it does to overcome filibuster and pass a bill. The fiscal year 2016 budget was tossed aside in less than 5 weeks. Our rules should make it harder to pass a bill that busts the congressional budget by requiring more votes to waive the violation.We must also create new rules to ensure Congress passes its annual spending measures on time. The current process has been completed on time only four times in the last 40 years, and the last time it was completed on time was in 1998.Obviously this year is no exception to the rule. Congress should set aside specific floor time only for consideration of spending bills and enact legislation establishing a two-year spending cycle, so that it has more time to review spending and complete its work. It should also enact Senator Portmanâ€™s legislation that would end government shutdowns to prevent our annual, end-of-year spending crises.These reforms and others would begin to create healthy fiscal habits that would force Congress to recognize and begin to address the daunting fiscal challenges that face our country.I will continue to tirelessly work to get as many of these budget reforms as possible enacted in the new Congress. Itâ€™s time to take seriously the crisis that is threatening the future financial solvency of this country.The American people have spoken, and we owe it to them to put politics aside and get back to work.Republican Mike Enzi represents Wyoming in the United States Senate where he serves as chairman of the Budget Committee."foxnews,Hillary Didn't 'Win' Majority of the Popular Vote,"By Matt Vespa | Townhall.comDemocrats are still licking their wounds, their supporters are still shell shocked over President-elect Donald Trumpâ€™s upset win over Clinton, and they keep peddling the myth that Clinton won the majority of the popular vote.

""I have known President Xi Jinping for many years and consider him an old friend. I look forward to building on our long friendship to cultivate and strengthen the relationship between our two countries and to benefit our economy.""Trump's offer was first reported by Bloomberg.Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence will hold a ""Thank You"" rally for supporters in Des Moines on Thursday. In last month's presidential election, Iowa voters backed the Republican ticket for just the second time since 1984.Branstad, 70, was an early and staunch supporter of Trump, and his son, Eric, served as the state director for Trump's campaign in Iowa.Branstad would assume the post at a pivotal moment in U.S-China relations, following Trump's Dec. 2 phone call with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen.The conversation broke nearly four decades of U.S. diplomatic protocol. Trump followed that with a series of Twitter posts over the weekend challenging China's trade and military policies.As a presidential candidate, Trump repeatedly accused China of manipulating its currency and trying to ""rape our country"" with unfair trade policies.Bloomberg reported that Branstad has a longstanding relationship with President Xi. Branstad first met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in 1985, when Xi, then a provincial agricultural official, visited Iowa.More recently, Brandstad gave a dinner for Xi in Des Moines in 2012 and has visited China four times in the past seven years.At a campaign rally in Sioux City Nov. 6, Trump called Branstad up to the stage, saying the governor ""would be our prime candidate to take care of China.""Trump has pledged to be more ""unpredictable"" on the world stage, billing the approach as a much-needed change from President Barack Obama's deliberative style and public forecasting about U.S. policy. But Trump's unpredictability is likely to unnerve both allies and adversaries, leaving glaring questions about whether the foreign policy novice is carrying out planned strategies or acting on impulse.China's authoritarian government likes predictability in its dealings with other nations, particularly the United States. The U.S. and China are the world's two largest economies with bilateral trade in goods and services reaching nearly $660 billion last year.While there have been sharp differences between Beijing and Washington on China's island building in the South China Sea and over alleged Chinese cybertheft of U.S. commercial secrets, the two powers have cooperated effectively on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal.Fox News' Serafin Gomez and the Associated Press contributed to this report."foxnews,Meet Lilou!

[5 Bold Claims of Alien Life]Field workAs reported online last week in the journal Nature Communications, field work in Chile by the ASU team â€” Steven Ruff and Jack Farmer of the university's School of Earth and Space Exploration â€” shows that the nodular and digitate silica structures at El Tatio that most closely resemble those on Mars include complex sedimentary structures produced by a combination of biotic and abiotic processes.""Although fully abiotic processes are not ruled out for the Martian silica structures, they satisfy an a priori definition of potential biosignatures,"" the researchers wrote in the study.Ancient settingSpirit landed on Mars in January 2004, a few weeks before its twin, Opportunity, touched down in a different part of the Red Planet. Both golf-cart-size rovers were tasked with looking for signs of past water activity during their missions, which were originally planned to last three months.Spirit encountered outcrops and regolith composed of opaline silica (amorphous SiO2nH2O) in an ancient volcanic hydrothermal setting in Gusev crater.An origin via either fumarole-related acid-sulfate leaching or precipitation from hot spring fluids was considered possible. ""However, the potential significance of the characteristic nodular and [millimeter]-scale digitate opaline silica structures was not recognized,"" Ruff and Farmer noted in the new study.El Tatio: Mars-like conditionsThe physical environment of El Tatio offers a rare combination of high elevation, low precipitation rate, high mean annual evaporation rate, common diurnal freeze-thaw and extremely high ultraviolet irradiance.""Such conditions provide a better environmental analog for Mars than those of Yellowstone National Park (USA) and other well-known geothermal sites on Earth,"" suggested Ruff and Farmer. ""Our results demonstrate that the more Mars-like conditions of El Tatio produce unique deposits, including biomediated silica structures, with characteristics that compare favorably with the Home Plate silica outcrops. The similarities raise the possibility that the Martian silica structures formed in a comparable manner.""Biosignature definitionPreviously, a NASA science team defined a potential biosignature as ""an object, substance and/or pattern that might have a biological origin and thus compels investigators to gather more data before reaching a conclusion as to the presence or absence of life.""""Because we can neither prove nor disprove a biological origin for the microstromatolite-like digitate silica structures at Home Plate, they constitute a potential biosignature according to this definition,"" Ruff and Farmer wrote.Spirit of future explorationSpirit bogged down on Mars in May 2009, becoming stuck in soft soil.In late January 2010, after months of attempts to free the rover, NASA dubbed the wheeled robot a stationary research platform. The lack of mobility and the harsh climes of Mars conspired to seal Spirit's fate, with attempts to regain contact with the robot ending in May 2011. Subsequently, NASA announced the end of contact efforts and the completion of Spiritâ€™s mission. (Opportunity is still going strong today.)The ASU researchers suggested that a future and specially instrumented rover mission could perhaps provide a more definitive assessment of possible biogenicity of Home Plate silica structures.""However, because of the challenges in obtaining unambiguous evidence in situ, coordinated microscopic and compositional analyses of samples returned to laboratories on Earth may be required to reach a robust conclusion as to the presence or absence of past Martian life in these rocks,"" Ruff and Farmer stated.The new study can be viewed here."foxnews,Is that a Yeti on a dashcam video in Russia?,"Could the dashboard video from a drive down a dark, winding, snowy road in the Russian countryside have turned up proof of the â€œmissing linkâ€ù that Yeti and Bigfoot chasers have been looking for?'YETI' SIGHTINGS ON THE RISE IN RUSSIAThe dashcam video, posted on Youtube, was reportedly shot in the Republic of Bashkortostan, located between the Ural mountains and the Volga River near the countryâ€™s Kazhakstan border.In the video, the carâ€™s driver and passengers are talking in Russian about Yetis (you can make out the word a couple of times in their conversation) when about 45 seconds into the video, a blurry figure darts across the road within range of the carâ€™s headlights!RUSSIAN AND US SCIENTISTS GATHER TO HUNT DOWN YETIThe vehicle stops immediately and its engine cuts out before it is restarted and continues over the figureâ€™s tracks, before reversing to get a better look.Could the alleged sighting of the alleged cousin of the alleged legendary Bigfoot be legit?

That's not the greatest news for Apple at this time, considering the iPhone battery performance issues it's already dealing with. But before you start to jump to conclusions, it's important to make it crystal clear that no, iPhones do not have a serious battery problem like the Galaxy Note 7.All battery-powered devices have a theoretical risk of explosion. It happens very infrequently with most devices, which is why it was immediately apparent that the Galaxy Note 7 has a more serious issue -- dozens of users reported unusual overheating and explosions immediately after the phone launched. Samsung ultimately had to admit defeat and cancel the handset two months after its release.According to The Wall Street Journal, Shanghai's Consumer Council is the group that issued the third battery-related complaint against Apple in China. The previous two concern spontaneous iPhone shutdowns even when there's still plenty of juice left in the device.Apple responded and stated that it has analyzed the affected iPhone 6 units and determined that the fires were caused by ""external physical damage."" The company also instructed customers to visit an Apple store or contact company support if they experience any issues with their iPhones.""We appreciate that customers are more concerned than ever about the performance and safety of batteries in their mobile devices,"" an Apple statement reads.Even so, Apple's battery troubles are far from over in the region. Earlier this week, Apple acknowledged that its iPhone 6s battery drain problem is more widespread than initially believed, saying that a software update might fix it. The company offers a free iPhone 6s battery replacement program, but it's not available to all iPhone 6s users in the region.Meanwhile, local consumer groups say that older iPhone models and iPhone 6s units not covered by the program are also affected by the same spontaneous shutdowns."foxnews,Travel Photos,"Â©2016 FOX News Network, LLC.

The Bahrain government is hosting its â€œnational dayâ€ù reception at President-elect Donald Trumpâ€™s elegant D.C. property Wednesday. This, amid reports that delegations from foreign countries are eagerly snapping up pricy rooms at the Pennsylvania Avenue location.Taken together, the developments give a snapshot of the kind of ethical entanglements Trump could face with his newest luxury property -- and the broader conflict of interest questions surrounding his business empire -- as he prepares to move into the White House less than a mile away.One Asian diplomat recently told The Washington Post: ""Why wouldn't I stay at his hotel blocks from the White House, so I can tell the new president, 'I love your new hotel!' Isn't it rude to come to his city and say, 'I am staying at your competitor?'""Larry Noble, general counsel with the Campaign Legal Center, cited this kind of scenario as a problem.â€œThey are saying that of course we'll stay at the Trump hotel. We're going to see the president and when we see the president, we want to say you have a wonderful hotel there,â€ù he told Fox News. â€œSo he's really profiting from this. It really creates real conflicts of interest.â€ùAt issue is the â€œforeign emoluments clauseâ€ù of the Constitution, which bars U.S. government officials from accepting gifts from foreign powers without congressional approval.Bahrain isnâ€™t the only foreign government sending money into the Trump Organizationâ€™s coffers this month. The Azerbaijani Embassy is hosting a Hanukkah party at the Trump hotel next week.Trump and his family say theyâ€™re trying to put up the necessary firewalls to settle any ethical questions.Shortly after his election, Trump declared he would be distancing himself from the business and making sure his children take on a bigger role in the Trump Organization.He and daughter Ivanka told CBSâ€™ â€œ60 Minutes the companyâ€™s brand paled in comparison to the importance of governing.â€œI don't think it matters. This is so much more important,â€ù Ivanka Trump said. â€œAnd more serious. And so â€_ you know, that's the focus.â€ùDonald Trump echoed his daughter messageâ€œThis is big league stuff. This is â€_ our country. Our country is going bad. We're going to save our country. I don't care about hotel occupancy. It's peanuts compared to what we're doing,â€ù he said.With the president-elect now promising a Dec. 15 news conference where he will officially turn over the business to his children, good government groups are suggesting that is not enough â€“ and the entire family should get out of the business.â€œI think this is a really dangerous area and I think he's going to see it,â€ù Noble said. â€œHopefully he's going to see it, and they're just going to divest.â€ùIn one curious development, while Ivanka Trump and her father said she and her siblings were taking on a bigger role in the business, reports have surfaced that she and her husband are moving to Washington â€“ suggesting she may instead be taking on a bigger role in the government and raising more questions of whoâ€™s poised to run the family business.Ed Henry currently serves as Fox News Channel's (FNC) chief White House correspondent.

We were born to be herbivores.Researchers in Israel have discovered the remains of 780,000-year-old edible plants that reveal the plant-based diet of the earliest humans, according to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.The more than 9,000 plant remains were discovered on the shoreline of Lake Hula, in the northern Jordan Valley. They date back to the Acheulian culture of 1.75-0.25 million years ago.Now theyâ€™re giving scientists an opportunity to study the plant-based diet of prehistoric humans from the Pleistocene age.The remains of the plants, many of which are considered extinct, were found during an archaeological excavation at Gesher Benot Ya'aqov. The damp conditions and lack of oxygen at the waterlogged site under the Jordan River and Lake Hula preserved the plant remains for hundreds of millennia.RARE, GOLD ROMAN COIN DISCOVERED IN JERUSALEM""This region is known for the wealth of plants, but what surprised us were the sources of plant food coming from the lake,â€ù Dr. Yoel Melamed of the Faculty of Life Sciences at Bar Ilan University, said in a statement. â€œWe found more than 10 species that existed here in prehistoric times but no longer today, such as two types of water nuts, from which seven were edible.""Among the remains were 55 species of edible plants, including seeds, fruits, nuts, leaves, stems, roots and tubers.""In recent years,â€ù said Naama Goren-Inbar, a professor at the Institute of Archeology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, â€œwe were met with a golden opportunity to reveal numerous remains of fruits, nuts and seeds from trees, shrubs and the lake, alongside the remains of animals and human-made stone tools in one locality.""Gesher Benot Ya'aqov is also where Goren-Inbar found the earliest evidence of the use of fire in Eurasia.""The use of fire is very important because a lot of the plants are toxic or inedible,â€ù Goren-Inbar said in the statement. â€œUsing fire, like roasting nuts and roots for example, allows the use of various parts of the plant and increases the diversity of the plant component of the Acheulian diet, alongside aquatic and terrestrial fauna."""foxnews,Power Play: Dingell on what's next for House Dems?,foxnews,Scientists develop robotic hand for people with quadriplegia,"Scientists have developed a mind-controlled robotic hand that allows people with certain types of spinal injuries to perform everyday tasks such as using a fork or drinking from a cup.The low-cost device was tested in Spain on six people with quadriplegia affecting their ability to grasp or manipulate objects.By wearing a cap that measures electric brain activity and eye movement the users were able to send signals to a tablet computer that controlled the glove-like device attached to their hand.Participants in the small-scale study were able to perform daily activities better with the robotic hand than without, according to results published Tuesday in the journal Science Robotics.The principle of using brain-controlled robotic aids to assist people with quadriplegia isn't new. But many existing systems require implants, which can cause health problems, or use wet gel to transmit signals from the scalp to the electrodes. The gel needs to be washed out of the user's hair afterward, making it impractical in daily life.""The participants, who had previously expressed difficulty in performing everyday tasks without assistance, rated the system as reliable and practical, and did not indicate any discomfort during or after use,"" the researchers said.It took participants just 10 minutes to learn how to use the system before they were able to carry out tasks such as picking up potato chips or signing a document.According to Surjo R. Soekadar, a neuroscientist at the University Hospital Tuebingen in Germany and lead author of the study, participants represented typical people with high spinal cord injuries, meaning they were able to move their shoulders but not their fingers.There were some limitations to the system, though. Users had to have sufficient function in their shoulder and arm to reach out with the robotic hand. And mounting the system required another person's help.Jan Schwab, an expert on spinal cord injury at Berlin's Charite hospital who wasn't involved in the research, called it an interesting pilot study that needs to be followed up with further clinical tests.""Bigger studies will be very important to find out which patients respond well, less well or not at all,"" Schwab said.Soekadar said the system could be brought to market within two years at a cost of between 5,000 and 10,000 euros ($5,370 to $10,740), depending on functionality.The device could also be used to help re-train the brain of stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation, he said."foxnews,O'Reilly: 'Dependent' Cities Like New York 'Will Never Embrace Trump',foxnews,Watch these tiger sharks feast on a whale carcass,"A stunning video posted by the Eco Abrolhos tour company in western Australia shows a gruesome sight: a plethora of tiger sharks feeding on, and swimming around, a whale carcass.The video shows the clear turquoise waters filled with sharks, blood from the dead whale, and two tour boats with passengers.

The spacecraft will then slowly spiral out to the moon on a 21-day transit before landing in the Mare Imbrium region of the moon, the same general region where China's first lunar lander, Chang'e-3, landed in 2013.TeamIndus is the fourth team to have its launch contract verified by the X Prize Foundation, a requirement for teams that wish to continue in the competition after this year. SpaceIL and Moon Express announced verified launch contracts in 2015, and Synergy Moon has its contract verified in August. A fifth team, Berlin-based PT Scientists, announced a launch contract Nov. 29, but said at the time they were still working with the X Prize Foundation to have it verified.The Google Lunar X Prize offers a $20 million grand prize to the first private team to land a spacecraft on the moon, travel at least 500 meters, and return high definition video and other data. The prize's deadline has been delayed several times since its introduction in 2007, with the latest deadline being the end of 2017.TeamIndus will be cutting it very close, with a launch scheduled for late December of 2017. In a Dec. 1 interview, Sheelika Ravishankar, an executive with TeamIndus, said she expected that the X Prize Foundation might extend the prize deadline by a few weeks if there was a team that launched by the end of 2017 but had not yet landed, but did not expect a longer and more general extension. ""There is no reason to extend the contest any more,"" she said, citing the contracts several other teams have announced for 2017 launches .TeamIndus also has an accelerated schedule for assembly of its lander and rover. The company expects to complete work on a qualification model of the spacecraft in a couple months, with work on flight hardware to start shortly thereafter. The spacecraft is scheduled to be completed in September for final testing and integration with its launch vehicle.The use of a dedicated launch vehicle, rather than flying as a secondary payload on another customer's launch, gives TeamIndus the capability to accommodate other team's rovers, Ravishankar said. ""We're in the final stages of inking a deal with one of the teams,"" she said.Such a partnership among competing teams is not unprecedented: another team, Astrobotic, plans to carry rovers for at least two other teams, although Astrobotic has not yet announced a launch contract for its mission.Ravishankar said the total cost of the mission, including launch, is about $65 million, which TeamIndus is raising through the sale of company equity, sponsorships, and a planned crowdfunding campaign set to begin in January.This story was provided by SpaceNews, dedicated to covering all aspects of the space industry."foxnews,Full Episodes: War Stories,"Full Episodes: War Stories (1 videos)Complete episodes of the series that reveals the courage and sacrifice of the Americans who serve in our nation's military"foxnews,Will Hawaii's snow storm ruin my vacation?

But the Hawaiian Islands have many different climate zones.When you hear itâ€™s snowing there, as was reported last weekend, itâ€™s usually only on the tops of the stateâ€™s highest mountains: Mauna Kea (literally â€œwhite mountainâ€ù in Hawaiian) and Mauna Loa in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, both on the â€œBig Islandâ€ù of Hawaii, and sometimes Mauna Haleakala on Maui.But below 10,000 feet, most tourist attractions are open and vacation activities are not affected.Here is a rundown of the effect, if any, of the snow that began to fall last Thursday:On the Big Island:The free Star Gazing Program at the top of Mauna Kea is the main tourism attraction affected by snow, according to Joan Harvey, director of sales and marketing at the Fairmont Orchid, Hawaii.The program, scheduled every night at the 9,200-foot level of Mauna Kea, features a PBS documentary called â€œFirst Lightâ€ù that describes the astronomical and cultural history of the mountain. Staff and volunteers set up telescopes for visitors, who can expect near-freezing temperatures even when the program is in full swing. But when it snows, or when itâ€™s foggy or cloudy, itâ€™s no-go.HAWAII BRACES FOR ANOTHER FOOT OF SNOWThe Fairmont Orchid sets up movies and craft activities for children when it rains, and it provides rain jackets and umbrellas for guests who choose to go shopping in Kona.â€œRain is very unusual for us,â€ù Harvey said, adding that it usually lasts for an hour or two. But on Monday she said it had been raining for a couple of days, which she called â€œextraordinary.â€ùAt Mauna Loa, the summit is closed above the Red Hill Cabin, which is a visitor destination only for back-country hikers, said Jessica Ferracane, a spokeswoman for Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Otherwise, the park is open, but visitors are reminded to drive with caution, said Park Superintendent Cindy Orlando. â€œRoads are flooded in places, and visitors might encounter fog, additional rain and other inclement weather today and as the week progresses,â€ù Orlando said on Monday.On Oahu, home to Waikiki Beach: Most activities continue, even in the rain. Many water activities take place rain or shine, said Nina Ganal, director of guest services at Starwood Waikiki Complex. If you sign up for an interactive dolphin program, a snorkeling excursion, scuba diving, a fishing charter or the Wet and Wild Hawaii waterpark on Oahu, expect the activity to take place. Rain usually doesnâ€™t mean thunder and lightning, said Jean Dickinson, a spokesperson for Starwood Hotels in the Hawaiian Islands.On Kauai, the â€œGarden Islandâ€ù: As of this writing, the skies were partly cloudy, and most scheduled activities were taking place. Horseback riding and the Wailua River cruise take place rain or shine, Dickinson said. If it rains, travelers are given rain gear. Swimming pools are generally open in the rain.

Terry Branstad as his pick for ambassador to China and asked retired Gen. John Kelly to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Trump announced late Wednesday as well that heâ€™ll nominate Linda McMahon, former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment, as administrator of the Small Business Administration.Pruitt may be the most controversial pick of the four.Pruitt, 48, has been a reliable booster of the fossil fuel industry and a critic of what he derides as the EPA's ""activist agenda.""Representing his state as attorney general since 2011, Pruitt has repeatedly sued the EPA to roll back environmental regulations and other health protections. He joined with other Republican attorneys general in opposing the Clean Power Plan, which seeks to limit planet-warming carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants. Pruitt has argued that curbing carbon emissions would trample the sovereignty of state governments, drive up electricity rates, threaten the reliability of the nation's power grid and ""create economic havoc.""His installment, if confirmed, would mark a significant break with the current EPA approach toward global warming.In an opinion article published earlier this year by National Review, Pruitt suggested the debate over global warming ""is far from settled"" and claimed ""scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.""He also filed court briefs in support of the Keystone XL Pipeline project blocked by the Obama administration, which would have run through his state. And Pruitt sued the EPA over the agency's recent expansion of water bodies regulated under the federal Clean Water Act.""Respect for private property rights have allowed our nation to thrive, but with the recently finalized rule, farmers, ranchers, developers, industry and individual property owners will now be subject to the unpredictable, unsound and often byzantine regulatory regime of the EPA,"" Pruitt said last year.As word of Pruitt's nomination spread Wednesday, environmental and liberal groups quickly responded with condemnation.Public Citizen called him a ""terrible choice,"" saying in a statement: ""Pruitt is cozy with the oil and gas industry and treats the EPA like an enemy.""Business leaders in his home state, however, lauded Pruitt's selection, especially those in the oil and gas industry.""Scott Pruitt is a businessman and public servant and understands the impact regulation and legislation have in the business world,"" said Jeffrey McDougall, chairman of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association.

While these leaders were more optimistic on future hiring and revenue growth, theyâ€™re pessimistic on plans for capital spending citing â€œregulationâ€ù as the top cost pressure.â€œWith a new President and Congress soon to take office, there is a real opportunity for Business Roundtable to be a positive influence and show how business plays a critical role in this [economic] growthâ€_â€ùsaid Dimon in a statement.Dimon is widely considered one of the world's top bankers. He guided the bank through the financial crisis of 2008 and it is now the nation's largest with $2.4 trillion in assets.

I think a number of the things that have been done over in the Labor Department relative to everything from overtime rules to some of the federal contracting restraints that were put in place,â€ù he said.As for trade policy, the group is more cautious.

And the best part: theyâ€™re held all over the country.Make it a tradition to head to one of these fun festivals. Some last just a weekend, others the entire holiday season.Here are 10 great places to get that holiday groove on from coast-to-coast:"foxnews,"Raging Oakland warehouse fire trapped victims in smoke, investigators say","The fire that killed 36 people during a party at an Oakland warehouse started on the ground floor and quickly raged, with smoke billowing into the second level and trapping victims whose only escape route was through the flames, federal investigators said Wednesday.""The occupants were consumed by smoke before they could get out of the building,"" said Jill Snyder, special agent in charge of the San Francisco office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.She also confirmed there were no sprinklers or fire alarm system in the building.Officials previously said recovery efforts at the site had ended with the death toll remaining at 36.Snyder reiterated that investigators were examining a refrigerator and other possibilities as a potential source of the fire but had not reached any conclusions. Investigators have not found evidence of arson, but she said they have also not ruled it out.Snyder did not give a timeline for the completion of the investigation.Officials hope to create a virtual, 3D reconstruction of the building for criminal and civil investigations and to provide answers to family members about their loved ones' last moments, Alameda County sheriff's Sgt. Ray Kelly said.""Where was my son or daughter? Where were they standing? How come they didn't get out?"" he said. ""Families want answers. They need answers.""The fire broke out during a dance party Friday night in the cluttered warehouse.The structure had been converted to artists' studios and illegal living spaces, and former denizens said it was a death trap of piled wood, furniture, snaking electrical cords and only two exits.Danielle Boudreaux, a 40-year-old hairdresser who was close with Derick Ion Almena, the founder of the artists' colony, and his partner, Micah Allison, said it was full of extension cords plugged into each other that helped supply power to music equipment, microwaves and hot plates.There were also RVs inside, she said.Almena has not responded to emails or calls by The Associated Press to phone numbers associated with him. He has said he didn't attend the event Friday night, and he is sorry.City and state officials fielded complaints for years about dangerous conditions, drugs, neglected children, trash, thefts and squabbles at the warehouse, raising questions about why it wasn't shut down. The district attorney has warned of possible murder charges as she determines whether there were any crimes linked to the blaze.The fire has cast a spotlight on similar artists' colonies around the San Francisco Bay Area that offer cheap housing in one of the country's priciest rental markets but have raised safety concerns among neighbors and city officials.Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said the city will look to strengthen regulations for smoke alarms and exits and clarify city employees' responsibilities to monitor unsafe structures.She said the city has been flooded with complaints about building safety since the fire and she wants to engage the arts community in the review to ensure any changes don't jeopardize their access to affordable housing and work space.On Wednesday, an Oakland restaurant owner, Dorothy King, called a news conference to say she was concerned the artists' warehouse next to her business could pose a safety hazard.Several artists tried to shout her down, accusing her of launching a ""witch hunt"" that could result in artists' collectives being shut down.King said that wasn't her intention.""I'm concerned about my business burning down. I'm concerned about a tragedy that could happen,"" she said.

John Kelly as his choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security, Fox News has learned.Kelly would be the third general Trump has picked for his administration, after announcing James Mattis â€“ who along with Kelly is a four-star general -- as his pick for Defense secretary. Trump also announced in November that retired Gen. Michael Flynn would be his national security adviser.Kelly retired from the Marine Corps earlier this year after leading U.S. Southern Command for three years, during which he was involved in the oversight of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay and the southern border.Kelly was picked by Defense Secretary Robert Gates to serve as his senior military adviser and then served in the same position under Leon Panetta before moving to Southern Command.Kelly complained at his last Pentagon press conference in January that after 40 years as a Marine he had the authority to watch drug dealers heading to the border by sea, but he could not disrupt them. He is believed to have a good relationship with current DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson, with whom he served as Pentagon general counsel.He served three tours in Iraq, and holds the somber distinction of being the most senior military officer to lose a child in combat in Iraq or Afghanistan. His son, Marine 2nd Lt. Robert Kelly was killed in November, 2010, in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.Known as an outspoken but loyal commander, Kelly will be first to lead the department who is not a lawyer and the fifth overall. The department was formed after the 9/11 terror attacks in order to help foil future attacks on the American homeland.Sources say Trump has settled on Kelly for the role, and is expected to name him in the next few days. Kellyâ€™s selection will require confirmation by the Senate.Immigration enforcement is a familiar issue for Kelly, and a big part of the DHS portfolio. Southern Command, which is based in South Florida, regularly works with DHS on missions to identify and dismantle immigrant smuggling networks. And it has partnered with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in an operation targeting human smuggling into the U.S. and helped with the rescue of children arriving alone at U.S. borders.While Trump has tapped military officials for key appointments, doing so can also bring complications. Gen. Mattis will need to secure a waiver from Congress in order to be considered due to a requirement that military officials be out of service for seven years before being secretary of Defense."foxnews,Appeals court throws out conviction of Waco man on death row,"Texas' highest criminal court threw out the conviction of a Waco man sent to death row for the 2011 ambush slayings of two men, saying Wednesday that a proper search warrant wasn't used to obtain text messages that tied him to the killings.The texts were used against ruled 29-year-old Albert Leslie Love Jr. at his capital murder trial.""The strongest evidence of his guilt came from the improperly admitted text messages,"" the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals said in a 6-3 ruling, but those messages ""could not be obtained without a probable-cause warrant.""Love is one of two men on death row for the fatal shootings of 17-year-old Tyus Sneed and 20-year-old Keenan Hubert, who were among four people sitting in a car who were shot in what prosecutors said was a gang-related ambush in retaliation for another killing. The slaying victims each had eight gunshot wounds.""Text messages are analogous to regular mail and email communications ... We hold that (Love) had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of the text messages he sent,"" the court said.McLennan County prosecutors had argued they obtained a ""court order"" to secure 37 pages of phone records showing about 1,600 text messages and the judge at Love's trial allowed the text messages into evidence over the objection of Love's attorneys.The appeals court, however, said the order pertained to other laws covering phones and was ""inapplicable"" to this case. It also said prosecutors could not compel Love's cellphone provider to turn over his messages ""without first obtaining a warrant supported by probable cause.""Love's appeals attorney, Ariel Payan, called the ruling ""kind of a once-in-a-lifetime deal.""""It was a little bit of a surprise, to be honest,"" he said, particularly after appeals court judges asked questions during oral arguments that gave him the impression of ""a lot of resistance"" to the appeal.McLennan County District Attorney Abel Reyna did not immediately respond to a message from The Associated Press.A jury in 2013 convicted Love of capital murder and then deliberated about 90 minutes before deciding he should be put to death rather than serve life without parole. His trial, moved to Georgetown because of publicity, came a year after a companion, Rickey Donnell Cummings, was sentenced to die. The appeals court a year ago upheld Cummings' conviction. Neither Cummings, 27, nor Love has had an execution date."foxnews,US pilot missing after ejecting from Marine Corps jet off Japan,"Crews were racing to find a U.S. Marine Corps pilot who ejected before his F/A-18 crashed off Japan, the Pentagon confirmed.The pilot ejected approximately 120 miles southeast of Iwakuni at about 6:40 p.m. local time.

Sterling Norton, 36. Norton's mother told Fox News at the time she wished the Marines would stop flying old planes.At one point, the head of Marine Corps aviation ordered a 24-hour pause in training operations around the fleet, except those participating in ISIS airstrikes.The Wednesday crash was also the fourth F/A-18 mishap since October, including an incident in November when two jets collided near San Diego.A Marine AV-8 crashed in September off Japan.Fox News' Lucas Tomlinson contributed to this report."foxnews,Why the fight for Mosul is far from over,foxnews,Rapper Conejo extradited from Mexico on murder charges after 14 years on the lam,"The Chicano rapper Jose Martin, aka â€œConejoâ€ù (â€œRabbitâ€ù), evaded U.S. authorities for almost 14 years while continuing to put out gangster-themed songs and videos.But on Nov. 16, Martin, 42, was arrested in Baja California in Mexico and, earlier this month, he was extradited to Los Angeles to face murder charges.To his fans Conejo is known for his label, Felony Case Records, his clothing line and framed photos of himself, but to Los Angeles police detectives and the FBI Fugitive Task Force he was a suspect in the 2001 murder of 25-year-old Mario Eduardo Gutierrez according to the Los Angeles Times.Conejo is known on the street as G-Rabbit or G-Rabbs. The neighborhood where he grew up is controlled by the Harpys, a Latino gang with ties to the Mexican Mafia.

Martin along with Edger Luna, aka â€œLooney,â€ù were identified as the principal suspects in the murder.Martin skipped out of town to Mexico not long afterward, the Times reported.Musically Martin found a measure of success in 2001 after his song â€œLet's Rideâ€ù which was featured on the TV show, â€œThe Shield.â€ùHe has released dozens of albums on iTunes while on the lam, and he has a number of devoted fans on social media.In 2012, Chicano rapper Serio released â€œDonâ€™t Hate Me 'Cause Iâ€™m Mexican.â€ù which featured Conejo and Proper Dos, one of the only collaborations.In recent weeks, Martinâ€™s Facebook page has made numerous pleas to ""Free Conejo,"" linking to a page on a crowd-funding site named Funded Justice. The goal of the page is to raise $30,000 for Conejo's defense. In 5 days, less than $1,000 has been pledged.Conejo's Facebook site also featured a recent video of a person wearing ski masks and hockey masks purportedly singing a track titled â€œStay Gangsterific.â€ùLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram"foxnews,FoxNews.com - Breaking News,foxnews,F-35A fighter jet in pictures,"F-35A fighter jet in picturesThe U.S. Air Force recently declared that its F-35A Lightning II fighter jet is combat ready.

He said he ducked down with the child and kept driving once he saw the gun.""He was driving around the corner and then he just like literally pulled out a gun and just shot on me while looking at me,"" the man said, noting later that none of the shots hit him or his nephew.The 911 recording from the shooting â€” the last confirmed attack by the suspect known as the Serial Street Shooter â€” was released as police say the number of tips coming in from the public has dwindled at an alarming rate.The cases remain a high priority for investigators, police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said. ""We feel there are people who either know who this man is or (have) strong suspicions,"" Howard said. ""We need those people to reach out to us to share their suspicions.""Police say the victims were attacked as they stood outside their homes or sat in vehicles after dark. They were fired upon by someone who was sitting in a car or had just stepped out of a vehicle. All but one of the killings has taken place in the city's Maryvale section, a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood Phoenix's west side.Investigators believe the crimes were carried out by a lanky Hispanic man in his early 20s, but they are leaving open the possibility that someone else may have participated in the attacks. They don't believe the attacks are racially motivated. No motive has been established.The victims include a 21-year-old man whose girlfriend was pregnant with their son and a 12-year-girl who was shot to death along with her mother and a friend of the woman.The July 11 shooting didn't occur in Maryvale, but rather in another neighborhood about 10 miles away.The 22-year-old victim didn't see the suspect's license plate number, but he caught a glimpse of the shooter, describing him as a Hispanic man in his early 20s who had short black hair. ""He saw me because I was riding with the windows down,"" the man told a 911 operator.Investigators found three bullet holes on the victim's car and recovered five shell casings from the scene, a police report says.In all, authorities say they have received more than 3,000 tips about the shootings that happened between March and July.Investigators are continuing to analyze physical evidence recovered from the scenes, seek out neighbors who might have security camera footage of the shootings and work with community groups to seek out useful information, Howard said.Tips that have already been investigated are being handed off to other officers to be re-examined in hopes that a fresh set of eyes will turn up something new.There are several theories on why the killer hasn't struck in nearly five months, including that he has decided to stop the attacks, has been locked up in jail for other reasons or moved to another location, Howard said.""We won't know what really happened until we capture him,"" he said.___Follow Jacques Billeaud at twitter.com/jacquesbilleaud.

Yet many demonstrators insisted that the bigger fight remains as firm as ever, claiming that the construction is only temporarily halted, and that the drilling will go on.â€œThis fight will end when we see the end of the outdated fossil fuel era, when this greed and destruction has been replaced by the sanity of sustainable systems that honor our earth and its people,â€ù stressed activist Nicole Fantl.If the elements, supplies and health risks werenâ€™t enough, there is always the danger violence could break out between law enforcement and demonstrators.â€œYou can still do security and you can be nice. But when they start throwing stones and rolling propane bombs at you, it is not being nice anymore,â€ù Reese said. â€œWe are outnumbered thousands to one. The law enforcement is outnumbered hundreds to one. It is a small law enforcement [presence] here and they are tapped out, these protesters are taking away other officers from their community. The locals are tired, their livestock is missing. This has been going on for months.â€ùLaw enforcement has characterized the protest as lawless, and more than 400 have been arrested. While most of the protesting is taking place in North Dakota, security and intelligence personnel did span South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois over steep concerns that the situation will spill over.Several sources also told FoxNews.com that protesters threatened the lives of employees and other figures connected to Energy Transfer Partners in Texas, which in recent weeks became a point of great concern for them and their families, some of who consulted private guard firms.However, protesters have vehemently denied unlawful behavior and paint a very different picture.â€œIt is a peaceful prayer camp and people adhere to and respect that. The people are respectful, conscious, educated and socially aware. The water protectors are not doing anything to warrant the violence against them,â€ù protester and filmmaker Elias Matar, 52, said, before hinting that some were concerned their electronic devices were hacked and tapped. â€œThere have been frequent incidents of phones displaying strange behavior.â€ùJamie Brennan contributed to this report"foxnews,FOX NEWS CHANNEL ACHIEVES MILESTONE BY DELIVERING ITS MOST WATCHED QUARTER EVER IN TOTAL DAY VIEWERSHIP â€“ Fox News Channel Press,"FNC Ranks #1 in Basic Cable in Q3 Primetime and Total Day Viewersâ€˜The Oâ€™Reilly Factorâ€™ Tops Q3 Total Viewers; â€˜The Kelly Fileâ€™ Tops Q3 24-54 Demoâ€˜Hannityâ€™ Leads Cable News 25-54 Demo in September While â€˜The Oâ€™Reilly Factorâ€™ Takes Number One in Total ViewersContinuing its record-breaking ratings year, FOX News Channel (FNC) topped basic cable in both primetime and total day as the most-watched network for the third quarter.

The spaceplane separated from WhiteKnightTwo at 10:40 a.m. ET, gliding back to a runway landing in Mojave 10 minutes later, according to updates provided by the company.The glide flight, which Virgin Galactic declared a success, begins the next phase in testing of the long-delayed suborbital vehicle that is ultimately designed to carry space tourists and research payloads to an altitude of about 62 miles, exposing them to several minutes of microgravity. [In Pictures: 1st Glide Flight of VSS Unity Spaceship]Virgin Galactic had planned to carry out the glide flight Nov. 1, but high winds led flight controllers to keep SpaceShipTwo attached to WhiteKnightTwo, turning the mission into the second ""captive carry"" test flight of the vehicle, after one in September. A second attempt, Nov. 3, was aborted because of an unspecified technical issue discovered prior to the planned release.The vehicles took to the air again Nov. 30 on another captive carry flight. ""As part of our ground & flight testing, we made a few tweaks to the vehicle,"" Virgin Galactic said in a tweet, which were tested on that flight. The company did not disclose the nature of the changes.The flight is the first in a series of glide flights to test the aerodynamic performance of the vehicle before moving ahead into powered flights. In an interview at the International Symposium for Personal and Commercial Spaceflight in Las Cruces, New Mexico, Oct. 13, Virgin Galactic President Mike Moses said the number of flights will depend on how long it takes to achieve a set of test objectives.""There's 10 glide flights' worth of targets,"" he said. ""We could do those in 8 flights, or might take 15, but we're not going into the next phase before we clear those.""Once completed, SpaceShipTwo will begin a set of powered test flights. The first SpaceShipTwo, named VSS Enterprise, was performing its fourth powered test flight when it crashed in October 2014, killing co-pilot Michael Alsbury and injuring pilot Peter Siebold.An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the vehicle broke up when Alsbury prematurely unlocked the vehicle's feathering mechanism, causing the tail section to rise up as the vehicle accelerated through Mach 1. The investigation criticized vehicle developer Scaled Composites for not taking steps to prevent such a premature unlocking and for creating a heavy workload for pilots of the vehicle.The stand-down after the accident gave Virgin Galactic time to work on the vehicle's hybrid rocket motor, whose development had been troubled. ""If the spaceship was ready, we could do a powered flight tomorrow,"" Moses said in October.This story was provided by SpaceNews , dedicated to covering all aspects of the space industry."foxnews,The challenges Gen.

The B.C.â€™s College of Physicians and Surgeons slammed his alleged request for patient funds in a statement to CTV News.â€œAny physicians who request money from patients to support him or her in retirement would be contravening a foundational principle which every physician is required to abide by: Do not exploit patients for personal advantage,â€ù the statement said.The report said MacDonald would not be disciplined but would not be allowed to accept money."foxnews,Skin-to-skin contact after birth good for mom and baby,"Skin-to-skin contact between mothers and newborns immediately after birth can be used to promote breastfeeding and may give babies a better start in life, according to a new review of existing evidence.Women who had skin-to-skin contact with their naked babies right after delivery were more likely to breastfeed longer and be breastfeeding months later than women who didn't have their babies placed on their skin right away, the researchers found.""The more you can do to place the mother and baby together and disturb them as little possible during that first hour, the better off they'll be,"" said lead author Elizabeth Moore, of the School of Nursing at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.Moore and her colleagues write in the Cochrane Library November 25th that babies are often separated from their mothers at birth. The new review looked at whether placing naked babies on their mother's bare chest improved breastfeeding and other health outcomes.The review was coordinated by the Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization that evaluates and reviews medical research.The researchers looked through medical literature and found 46 randomized controlled trials to include in their review. The trials included 3,850 women and their newborns from 21 countries. All babies were healthy and most were born at term.""We compared those trials to usual care, and usual care was very different depending on the trial,"" said Moore. Trials from the 1970s may have separated mothers from their babies for hours. In more modern trials, babies might be swaddled in a blanket before being handed to the mother.Compared to babies and mothers who received usual care, those who received skin-to-skin contact immediately after birth were about 24 percent more likely to still be breastfeeding one to four months later.Infants who received skin-to-skin care were also 32 percent more likely to successfully breastfeed on their first try.There was also evidence that women who got skin-to-skin contact breastfed longer and were more likely to exclusively breastfeed after leaving the hospital.Evidence also suggested babies did better after receiving skin-to-skin contact after birth. They had higher scores on a measure evaluating their heart and lung function, had higher blood sugar levels and had a similar body temperature to their swaddled counterparts.""It's just something that if at all possible should happen,"" Moore told Reuters Health.Skin-to-skin contact should begin as soon as possible and last for at least 60 minutes, she said. The hour will give babies time to recover from the birthing experience, find the mother's nipple and latch on.""It's not something you can do in just 15 minutes,"" she said.Moore said more research is needed on skin-to-skin contact after cesarean births and among babies born near full term.""I think skin-to-skin care or contact is a no-cost intervention that improves outcomes for mothers and babies,"" said Jeannette Crenshaw, of Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center School of Nursing in Lubbock.Crenshaw, who is presently involved in a study of skin-to-skin contact after cesarean sections, said the current findings confirm the results of earlier, less rigorous studies that showed similar benefits.""We need to adjust our processes, normal routines and make system changes to make the best practice available to mothers and babies,"" said Crenshaw.Moore said receiving skin-to-skin contact is often dependent on doctors being comfortable with the practice.""I would recommend that a woman make sure she adds skin-to-skin to her birth plan,"" she said. ""I think it's a really good thing for a woman to put together a birth plan before she heads to the hospital and show it to her physicians or midwife."""foxnews,2 toddlers die after steam burns possibly caused by radiator in NYC apartment,"Two sibling toddlers died Wednesday after suffering steam burns in a New York City apartment, and investigators are looking into whether a radiator malfunctioned, authorities said.""Our city is mourning the loss of two young children in a tragedy earlier today that appears to be connected to a steam radiator in their family's Bronx apartment,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement.Firefighters who rushed to the building, which housed several homeless families, were met in the lobby by the victim's father with the unconscious girls, New York Fire Department spokesman Jim Long said.The firefighters immediately performed CPR on the toddlers, Long said.The girls, identified as Scylee Vayoh Ambrose, 1, and Ibanez Ambrose, 2, were taken to a hospital where they were pronounced dead Wednesday afternoon.""I saw the firemen carry them out,"" neighbor Eddie Perez, 68, told the Daily News.

Bush, who was a senior in high school at the time. The gravity of what happened is what compelled him to temporarily forego his college plans and join the United States military.â€œWe gotta do something about this,â€ù recalled President Bush, in an op-ed article published by USA Today.Bush went on to become the youngest naval pilot of his time, commissioned just a few days before his 19th birthday. Then on September 2, 1944, the plane he was flying came under enemy fire and was hit. The former president managed to safely bail from his burning aircraft and was later plucked from a raft, in the middle of the sea, by the USS Finback, a lifeguard submarine.More than seven decades later, vintage WWII-era planes, just like the one Bush used to fly, soared over the crowd of spectators as part of the Pearl Harbor commemoration at his library in College Station, Texas.A moment of silence was also held at 11:55 Central time, or 7:55am in Hawaii, the exact moment the attack on Pearl Harbor began.The afternoon program included a panel, moderated by Brit Hume of Fox News.More than 20 World War II veterans were among the distinguished guests in attendance at the Bush Presidential Library â€“ including former Senator Bob Dole and Aaron Cook, the sole Pearl Harbor survivor in Wednesday's crowd.â€œI don't really know how to describe it,â€ù Cook said.Cook was just 19 at the time, and was working as a Chief Petty Officer in the US Navy, stationed on Ford Island. He remembers seeing the planes swoop in and unleash bombs.â€œIn retrospect, I'm glad I'm here. And I'm glad the country has survived,â€ù he explained.Now in his 90s, Cook said itâ€™s important to pay homage so that future generations can understand the significance of that day and a valuable piece of history simply isnâ€™t forgotten when he and his fellow troops are gone.â€œPeople just don't seem to be responsive. Kids go to sleep when you're talking to classes and they don't even know what Pearl Harbor is. They just don't realize how important it is,â€ù he added.To help educate and further inform the public about the significance of Pearl Harbor, a special exhibit has been set up at the President Bush Presidential Library and Museum, which will run through the end of this year.â€œWe began working on this about six months ago,â€ù said David Jones, CEO of the George Bush Presidential Library Foundation.â€œTwenty-five years ago President Bush spoke at the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, as the sitting president, and we have a copy of the speech in our auditorium here on a continuous loop,â€ù Jones said.There also is a digitally re-mastered version of President Franklin Delano Rooseveltâ€™s famed speech for spectators to view, with the words of comfort he offered to stunned-Americans after the attacks.Casey Stegall joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in 2007 and currently serves as a correspondent based in the Dallas bureau.

Bush, had several animals, including Barney, a Scottish terrier, Miss Beazley, a puppy of the same breed, and India ""Willie"" the cat.Other presidential pets include Bill Clinton's chocolate Labrador retriever, Buddy, and George H. W. Bush's Springer Spaniel, Millie.President George Washington kept a parrot named Polly and Theodore Roosevelt owned an array of animals: dogs, cats, guinea pigs, snakes and a badger named Josiah.While Patton hails from a military dog family, his owner said he enjoys the same activities as any other pooch. The puppy, who is currently 20 pounds and ""getting bigger by the day,"" swims in Pope's pool at her Manalapan, Fla., home and prefers scrambled eggs for breakfast after his daily ""puppy chow."" Patton and his 12-inch rawhide bone are inseparable, she said.""Heâ€™s unbelievably smart and a good swimmer,"" Pope said.As of Wednesday, there was no official word from the Trump transition team about whether Patton will join the president-elect's family.But Pope said she's optimistic the Trumps will adopt the puppy -- who could be heard barking in the background during a phone interview Wednesday morning.""I'm confident they will take him for Barron,"" Pope said. ""This will be the First Dog for the First Son.""""He is a puppy worthy of the presidency,"" she said."foxnews,"Pfizer fined for hiking epilepsy drug price 2,600 percent in UK","British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent.Pfizer and Flynn Pharma charged ""excessive and unfair prices"" for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds.""This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,"" Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement.The authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer's name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012.""The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,"" Marsden said.Pfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma.""In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,"" Pfizer said.Pfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS.""The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,"" the company said. ""Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.""Regulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development.In one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions.In another, Turing Pharmaceuticals' former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients."foxnews,'Biggest Loser' winner Ali Vincent opens up on gaining weight after the show,"It's been eight years since Ali Vincent was crowned the first female winner of NBC's ""The Biggest Loser"" in 2008.

But the GOP hopes to widen its slim majority in the upper chamber in Louisiana on Saturday, when two finalists compete in a runoff for the open seat of retiring GOP Sen. David Vitter.A Republican win would give the party a 52-48 seat majority in the Senate next year.The contest between GOP candidate John Kennedy, the state treasurer, and Democratic opponent Foster Campbell, a state Public Service commissioner, also has emerged as a final proxy battle between the Trump campaign and supporters of failed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.State Republicans announced Wednesday that Trump, now the president-elect, will visit Baton Rouge on Friday to lead a get-out-the-vote rally for Kennedy.Kennedy leads Campbell by 14 percentage points in the runoff race, according to the most recent polling by Southern Media Opinion and Research.They enter the runoff as the top two vote-getters in the Nov. 8 general election in which nobody in the 12-person field could surpass the 50 percent threshold to win.Related Image Expand / Contract FILE - In this Nov. 2, 2016 file photo, Senate candidates, left to right, Rep. Charles Boustany, D-La., Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell, David Duke, attorney Carolyn Fayard, Rep. John Fleming, R-La., and Louisiana Treasurer John Neely Kennedy take their places before a debate at Dillard University in New Orleans. (AP)The GOP in 2016 had incumbent senators in 24 races, which gave Democrats their best opportunity in years to retake control of the chamber. But the populist wave that swept Trump into the White House also helped fellow Republicans keep their House and Senate majorities.A GOP win this weekend would be cause for a final, 2016 celebration for the party.This past weekend, Vice President-elect Mike Pence was in Louisiana trying to whip up votes for Kennedy.â€œI just hung up the phone from President-elect Trump,â€ù Pence told the crowd. â€œHe said to â€_ say how grateful he was for the support from Louisiana. He said that he has one more thing to ask, to send John Kennedy to the United States Senate.â€ùDespite having a Democratic governor, Louisiana is deep red and has voted for the GOP presidential nominee in eight of the past 10 contests, including this year when Trump decisively beat Clinton, 58-38 percent.As Pence suggested Saturday, his visit with Trump this summer to flood-ravaged Louisiana -- a trip Clinton didn't make -- only strengthened the bond between Republicans and Louisiana voters.â€œThe most inspiring day for me on the campaign was back in August,â€ù he said. â€œLouisiana, you inspired the nation. And I promise that our president-elect and I will be with you.â€ùSouthern Media pollster Bernie Pinsonat on Tuesday told FoxNews.com: â€œTrump is very popular here. The issue is very simple: Trump stomped Clinton.â€ùClinton supporters and other Democrats have tried to help Campbell, giving enough money, much of it in small-dollar donations, to essentially keep him evenly matched with Kennedy. Each has roughly $1.4 million in cash going into Saturdayâ€™s runoff, according to OpenSecrets.org.Still, Campbell faces an uphill battle in trying to erase Kennedyâ€™s 52-38 point lead with the runoff just days away.Beyond the Trump effect, Louisianaâ€™s $300 million budget deficit is a big factor in the contest.Pinsonat said Kennedy climbed to the top of the race because he was a state treasurer with the popular message that Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwardsâ€™ administration was spending too much.â€œHe had a microphone to go across the state,â€ù Pinsonat said. â€œHe was the peopleâ€™s choice on the budget.â€ùThe Southern Media poll showed voters agreed with Kennedy 54-40 percent on overspending, not Edwardsâ€™ argument that state government needs more revenue.If Campbell has one advantage compared with last month's candidates, it is that he is the only Democratic Senate contender this year who can tell voters exactly how he would deal with a new president -- since Trump has already won.""If he wants to build roads and bridges, I'm all about that,"" Campbell recently said on the ""Keepin' It 1600"" podcast. ""But if he wants to privatize Social Security and he wants to give a voucher for Medicare, I cannot support that.

Not long ago, a 79-year-old lady in Caracas, Venezuela, received her pension in such way â€” a mountain of bolivar bills she had trouble taking home.â€œI have to put them in the suitcase, because they donâ€™t fit in my wallet,â€ù Clarisa Matson de Garcia told Fox News Latino. â€œAnd then I pray that nobody robs me in the street.â€ùWith the enormously devalued Venezuelan currency ($1 equals roughly 4,400 bolivars in the black market), those 20,000 bolivars barely pay for a T-shirt or a birthday cake.The highest denomination bill in the country is currently 100 bolÃ_vars, the cost of a piece of candy. In a country where approximately 35 percent of the population does not have a bank account, the out-of-control inflation has turned every petty errand and transaction into a major headache.â€œSometimes, when I try to pay with a pile of 10 bolÃ_vars, people donâ€™t accept it,â€ù Matson de Garcia said.Last week, after months of popular clamor, the Central Bank announced that in mid-December it will start rolling out bills of higher denominations. The new highest bill will be 20,000 bolivars â€” some $4.55 in the black market rate, the only market actually available to Venezuelans due to the government's tight currency control.But it will not happen overnight. This week, Central Bank president Nelson Merentes said that on Dec. 15 the bank will start circulating 500 bolivars bills. The other denominations â€“ 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000 and 20,000 â€“ will be issued at a later time.Most economists agree that issuing new bills will alleviate the problem, but not solve it.â€œItâ€™s a relief because the ATMs will have bills of greater denomination, and people wonâ€™t have to withdraw 60 bills of 100 bolÃ_vars to pay for a taxi,â€ù said economist Victor Alvarez. â€œYouâ€™ll be able to do it with six. It will relieve some of the operations in the informal sector.â€ùThe shortage of cash is being increasingly felt in ATMs and banks across the country â€” now Venezuelans need to wait in long lines not only to get food and other essentials, but also to get their own money (limited to 10,000 bolivars a day).Last Sunday, one of the main shopping malls of Caracas, Sambil, had just one ATM in service.â€œI didnâ€™t have cash to pay the bus home,â€ù Roberto Aponte, a young man who had come to the mall to watch a movie, told FNL. â€œIt took me an hour to get the money.â€ùEconomist Asdrubal Oliveros, director of Ecoanalitica, explained that the cash shortage is due to the fact that currency in Venezuela is rendered useless by the country's chronic inflation.â€œThe value of things is way above the bills that we have, and citizens need more bills to do the most elementary things,â€ù Oliveros said.A foreign correspondent working in Caracas, who asked not to be named and does not have a bank account, said he moves around the city with several bags of cash and his pockets full of bills in order to pay for the most basic things.He said he recently went out to dinner at a restaurant with a friend and the check came to 25,000 bolivars. He used 250 hundred-bolivar bills to pay.It makes any kind of shopping cumbersome.â€œIâ€™ve been preparing for Christmas for two months now,â€ù he told FNL.

But the creature, Majungasaurus crenatissimus, took more than 20 years to reach its full size, making it one of the slowest growing dinosaurs of its kind on record, a new study finds.The finding suggests that M. crenatissimus was a real pipsqueak for most of its life, at least compared with its fast-growing, enormous relatives Tyrannosaurus rex and Albertosaurus, said study lead researcher Michael D'Emic, an assistant professor of biology at Adelphi University in Long Island, New York. [Image Gallery: Tiny-Armed Dinosaurs]Malagasy dinosaurThe researchers chose to study M. crenatissimus because it was a common dinosaur with multiple specimens available for study. ""It's literally known from thousands of teeth, hundreds of isolated bones and several nearly complete skeletons,"" D'Emic told Live Science.M. crenatissimus was top predator on the island of Madagascar during the late Cretaceous period, about 70 million to 66 million years ago. M. crenatissimus is considered an abelisaurid theropod â€” a bipedal, carnivorous dinosaur with stubby front arms; small, pointy teeth; and a short skull, D'Emic said.When full-grown, the beast would have extended about 20 feet in length, according to a 2007 study in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.But it took most of its life to reach that length, D'Emic found. The individual the researchers studied likely weighed about 1,875 lbs. when it died at about age 27. In comparison, ""T. rex was at 800 kilograms in just a few years,"" before it eventually reached its full size of about 9 tons in adulthood, D'Emic said.Rock-saw sliceTo analyze the M. crenatissimus individual, one of the largest and most complete on record, the researchers used a rock saw to get slices from eight bones: the dorsal rib, pubis, scapula, phalanx, metatarsal and three leg bones â€” the fibula, tibia and femur.To preserve the original shape of the skeleton, they used a mold to form an epoxy in the shape of the slices removed from those bones. Then they placed the replicas back into the skeleton.""Although it's destructive sampling, you can restore the specimen to its original morphology,"" D'Emic said.Once they had the eight slices, D'Emic and his colleagues mounted them on microscope slides and then ground them down until they were transparent (about the thickness of a human hair) and. ""It's a slow, time-consuming process,"" he said.Once he was done, D'Emic was able to easily view each individual line of arrest growth (LAG). Just like tree rings, LAGs that were close together indicated that the dinosaur didn't grow much that particular year, while rings that were far apart implied that the dinosaur had undergone a growth spurt, D'Emic said.Many of the LAGs were close together, indicating that the dinosaur grew slowly in comparison to its theropod relatives. For example, the allosauroid Acrocanthosaurus reached about 7,700 lbs. in about the same time it took M. crenatissimus to reachjust a quarter of that weight, D'Emic said.It's unclear why M. crenatissimus grew so slowly, but perhaps the harsh Malagasy environment, plagued by droughts and floods, curtailed its growth, D'Emic said. In addition, research shows that other abelisaurids grew slowly, so it may be a common characteristic of the group, he said. [Gory Guts: Photos of a T. Rex Autopsy]Childhood mysteryHowever, some information is missing from the dinosaur's youth. Some bones, such as the tibia, contained bone marrow in their center that remodeled the bone (and the LAGs) around them, meaning that the dinosaur's early years were effectively erased.But, by examining the spacing of the later years, they were able to guess how many rings made up the inner region covered by bone marrow. In the end, they guessed that there were 14, which helped them estimate the dinosaur's age of 27, he said. The researchers plan to study a juvenile M. crenatissimus to see whether its young LAGs are spaced as they predicted they would be, D'Emic said.The research is part of the Madagascar Paleontology Project, in which researchers are studying bone structure and LAGs of other vertebrates that lived in Madagascar's Maevarano Formation, widely known as a stressful Cretaceous ecosystem, said study co-researcher Kristina Curry Rogers, an associate professor of geology and biology at Macalester College in Minnesota.For instance, earlier this year, Curry Rogers, D'Emic and their colleagues published a study in the journal Science on the remains of a baby titanosaur (Rapetosaurus), a long-necked and long-tailed herbivore from Madagascar. They found that the baby likely died of starvation during a drought. But during its short life, it grew very fast, likely at the same rate as a modern baby elephant, she said.The new study, which has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, was presented Oct. 28 at the 2016 Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting in Salt Lake City.Original article on Live Science."foxnews,Chicken Recall,"A warning about some chicken which could make you sick.FOXâ€™s Lilian Woo reports:Nearly two million pounds of chicken are being recalled because the products sold as fully cooked may actually not be.

It appears that, especially on the left, most of the concern is that he will turn into a racist dictator of some sort.However, the left, as they so often do, is not only overplaying their hand with regard to who Donald Trump is, but they are also missing the primary point almost entirely.

Judging from his first month as â€œpresident-elect,â€ù it is very clear that the Trumpian view of the presidency is much more in line with that of the early 20th Century British monarchy than how our founders conceived of the position of commander in chief (heck, have you seen his living quarters in Trump Tower?!)."foxnews,"J&J questions fairness of hip implant trial, $1B verdict","Johnson & Johnson will challenge the fairness of a trial that produced a verdict of $1 billion in damages against the company last week over allegations of design flaws in its Pinnacle hip implant.Although legal experts think J&J faces an uphill battle, both they and investors believe the Texas jury's penalty, the largest product liability verdict so far this year, is unlikely to stand.In the two-month trial, five separate people from California argued that design flaws in the metal-on-metal implant made by J&J subsidiary DePuy Orthopaedics caused tissue death, bone erosion and other injuries.It is the second large verdict against J&J in the Pinnacle implant litigation, which has been consolidated before U.S. District Court Judge Edward Kinkeade in Texas. In July, another jury awarded six Texas plaintiffs $500 million. Both cases were so-called bellwethers, intended to gauge the value of claims for more than 9,000 other pending implant cases.J&J said in a statement it was confident in its appeal prospects and would not settle. It also said it stood by the safety of its product.Last Thursday's verdict has had little impact on J&J stock. Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager with ESquared Asset Management, said investors assume large health products companies will occasionally be sued and lose and that the costs are ultimately manageable.J&J said it will ask Kinkeade to reduce or throw out the jury award before appealing to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. According to the company, the multi-plaintiff format stacked the deck against it by parading a series of victims in front of the jury and exaggerating the number of complaints about the implant.The company won the first bellwether trial in a case involving a single plaintiff in 2014. The next is scheduled for September 2017, and Kinkeade has not decided how many plaintiffs will be involved in that trial.These results ""perfectly illustrate the distortions and confusion inherent in multi-plaintiff trials and underscore the extent of the legal errors that have been repeated,"" said J&J defense lawyer John Beisner.But several legal experts said such a challenge faced long odds. Lynn Baker, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, noted trial judges are normally given great leeway in managing their cases and multi-plaintiff trials were a long-established means of clearing dockets faster.""I would not expect J&J to succeed on a claim that they were prejudiced by the multi-plaintiff bellwether format,"" she said.J&J also said the judge allowed plaintiffs' lawyers to present inflammatory and prejudicial testimony to the juries, raising bribery accusations against the company and claims that the metal-on-metal implants could cause cancer.University of Richmond School of Law Professor Carl Tobias said an appeals court was unlikely to overturn the verdict on such grounds though. ""Unless there is clear prejudice on the part of the jury, you've got to defer to the factfinder,"" he said.But even without showing its trial was unfair, the professors said J&J's case was strong for having the $1 billion award reduced on the grounds that it is excessive.Kinkeade cut the $500 million July verdict to $151 million.Andrew Bradt, a professor at University of California Berkeley School of Law, noted the U.S. Supreme Court has held punitive damages should be no more than 10 times compensatory damages. The $1.041 billion award was mainly punitive, with just $32 million in compensatory damages.Bradt said the final award could be even lower than $320 million, since the high court has also said punitive damages awards should be closely tied to plaintiffs' injuries rather than as a broader deterrent."foxnews,Pretty stars who go gritty on film,"Penelope Cruz's hubby was almost unrecognizable in the Bond film ""Skyfall.""

But that's exactly what unfolded on the Senate floor Wednesday as two Democrats went to the mat to force the Senate to cut a better health care deal for coal miners.Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.,and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, both vulnerable senators facing re-election in 2018, took to the Senate floor to block a host of bills and resolutions that usually sail through unnoticed.Manchin and Brown want a longer guarantee of health benefits for miners beyond April 28. The miners' health care issue has emerged as a flashpoint on a bill to fund the government through next spring. Funding for the government expires Friday night.Sen. Thom Tillis, R-NC, repeatedly tried to get clearance from Manchin and Brown on a panoply of non-controversial bills Wednesday night. But the Democrats repeatedly objected, effectively blocking each item.At one point, Tillis tried to advance a measure observing the 75th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor.

And in Bangladesh, the rate of reduction was less than 1 percent from 2010 to 2015, compared to 10.9 percent between 1997 and 2002.While soaring rice prices and poorer growth in agricultural productivity have played a role, slowing economic growth is the main driving force behind slower reductions in hunger, said David Dawe, FAO senior economist and one of the study's authors.Economic growth for Asia was 5.9 percent last year, down from 6.3 percent in 2014 and an average of nearly 8 percent over the previous decade. With less money in their pockets, poor families buy less food.As a result, 12 percent of the region's population - or some 490 million people - remain undernourished, with most of them in Southern Asia. Region-wide, nearly one out of three children suffers from stunting, which carries severe, irreversible consequences for both physical health and cognitive function.With more than 60 percent of the world's hungry living in Asia-Pacific, the slower progress in the region has led to high global numbers of the chronically hungry.Worldwide, 805 million people suffered from chronic hunger between 2012 and 2014. While chronic malnutrition as measured by stunting has declined, some 161 million children below five years were affected in 2013.Poor nutrition is the main underlying cause of death among five-year-old and younger children, responsible for 45 percent of all child deaths globally in 2013, the study said.At stake is also the target of achieving zero hunger worldwide by 2030, one of the U.N.'s Sustainable Development Goals agreed last year.At most recent rates, only two countries in Asia are on course to eliminating hunger by 2030, researchers said.The study's authors urged governments in Asia-Pacific to accelerate their efforts with efforts investing more in agricultural research to produce food more efficiently and building roads to help rural poor travel and find jobs more easily."foxnews,Want to monitor bears? Try checking their saliva,"Scientists may very well be drooling over a tasty bear monitoring method in Alaska, and the key ingredients are bear saliva and salmon.The technique involves gleaning genetic information from salmon that brown bears have munched on, and researchers report that it works better, and is cheaper, than previous methods like using feces to identify the bears. Luckily for science, bears donâ€™t always finish their salmon meals, and that means that the fish carcasses are a great place for scientists to get ursine DNA, according to a new study.â€œWhen salmon are plentiful, bears rarely eat the entire fish. In some cases, they only eat the brain, and weâ€™ve found that swabbing along the edges of the braincase gives us the best results for extracting DNA,â€ù Rachel Wheat, first author on the new study, said in a statement. â€œWe also had success with swabbing inside distinct bite holes, and in the muscle tissue where the bears have stripped the skin off the salmon.â€ùWHY I GOT MY DNA TESTEDThe researchers focused on two types of salmon, chum and sockeye, in two watersheds in southeast Alaska, and got their data from 156 fish bodies. As a comparison, they also took swabs from bear scats. It turns out that they were more likely to get genetic information from the fish carcasses than the bear feces: more than 50 percent of the fish provided bear DNA, compared to just 35 percent from the bear scat. The saliva method was also much cheaper, with the fishâ€™s braincase providing better info than bite holes.The technique is a â€œpromising methodâ€ù towards monitoring animals like bears, according to the study, which was published this month in the journal PLOS ONE.â€œThis advance will help allow us to more effectively â€“ and more economically â€“ study one of the largest bears on the planet,â€ù Wheat said in the statement.Follow Rob Verger on Twitter: @robverger"foxnews,Report of missing data in election-related incident survey,foxnews,Dinosaurs in Denali: National park yields first dino bone discovery,"Alaskaâ€™s Denali National Park just threw researchers a major, ancient bone.In July, while a team was working alongside the National Park Service, it discovered four â€œsignificantâ€ù fragments, including an ossified tendon. These fragments were â€œclearly parts of bigger bones from a large animal,â€ù wrote the team in a press release.Pat Druckenmiller, curator of Earth sciences at the University of Alaska Museum of the North, said the tendon fragments probably belonged to a hadrosaur. These duck-billed larger ornithopod dinosaurs were herbivorous and are thought to have been the most abundant large animals in Alaska.â€œAnother larger fragment is composed of spongy bone originating from the end of a large animalâ€™s limb. This microstructure shows the bone didnâ€™t come from a crocodile or other slow-growing, cold-blooded animal. It is clearly from a medium-sized to large dinosaur,â€ù wrote the team.This discovery comes more than a decade after the first dinosaur evidence first surfaced. In 2005, animal tracks were found in the Cantwell Formation near Igloo Creek. Although thousands of tracks have been found in the park since then, the fragments represent the first identifiable bones from animals dating to the Cretaceous period.Druckenmiller and Denali National Park will collaborate over the next several years and explore additional areas of the preserve, looking to make new discoveries, according to the team.â€œThis marks the beginning of a multi-year project to locate, document and study dinosaur fossils in Denali National Park,â€ù Druckenmiller said. â€œThis is a world-class site for tracks of dinosaurs and other animals that lived in Alaska during the Cretaceous Period.

Will you still be safe?,"This past week, the House of Representatives passed legislation that has become known as the 21st Century Cures Act. Wednesday, the Senate also passed the Act.This is thought to be the largest and most powerful healthcare related law since the passage of the Affordable Care Act during Obamaâ€™s first term.The Cures Act provides for a large increase in funds for boosting biomedical research and also takes aim at speeding up drug and medical device approvals through the Federal Drug Administration (FDA).As expected, other items are also placed inside this bill such as funding for Opioid abuse as well as a program to better treat mental illness as well as research funding for ObamaCareâ€”making it very likely that President Obama will sign the measure that contains 6.8 billion dollars in funding now that it has also been approved by the Senate.In spite of opposition by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders the bill passed and is likely to find its way to President Obamaâ€™s desk very soon.There appears to be widespread support of the bill in the scientific community particularly amongst those that are involved in medical innovation and research.Many medical researchers have worried about what may happen to important and essential research funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under a Trump administration and this new law would provide for more that 4 billion dollars for the NIH over the next decade. The NIH supports some of the most important medical and healthcare research in the world.How Might This Law Affect the FDA Process?Currently drug and device makers must present data obtained from rigorous randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs). Often RCTs require years to complete and involve the enrollment of thousands of patients. RCTs â€“because these trials prove cause and effect--provide the best type of evidence for the safety and efficacy of a drug or device. Under the new law, companies would be able to use â€œsurrogate endpointsâ€ù rather than hard outcomes to obtain approvalsâ€”this would make it far less expensive and time consuming for pharmaceutical and device companies to move new products through the FDA at a much quicker pace. Company controlled registry data would be accepted as evidence and RTCs would not always be required. In addition, observational dataâ€”which statistically shows â€œassociationâ€ù but does not prove â€œcause and effectâ€ùâ€”will also be considered by the FDA during the approval process. During the last year, lobbyists have flooded Congress on behalf of drug and device makers in order to promote the passage of the CURES act . Pharma as well as the device industry stand to realize huge gains if it becomes law.What Could This Mean for Health Care Consumers?Proponents of the legislation argue that this will be a huge step forward in public health. By providing such a large amount of funding for biomedical research as well as funding for work on opioid addiction and mental health treatments, that are likely to provide better treatment options for millions of Americans. In addition, simplifying the FDA approval process is likely to spur innovationâ€”companies will be able to devote more time to research and development and patients will be able to reap the benefits of new therapies much faster. The FDA process is currently weighed down with lots of rules and regulationsâ€”providing a clearer path to approval may encourage smaller innovators and entrepreneurs to produce new products.Opponents to the law argue that removing the requirement for robust data with hard endpoints to support the safety and efficacy of new drugs and devices may place patients at risk. Consumer and public safety groups worry that the law may open the door to the approval of unsafe drug and device approvals. Using observational data and patient feedback rather than RTCs may allow unsafe drugs and devices to enter the market; Companies may be incentivized to rush drugs and devices to the market with only anecdotal evidence in support of their efficacy or safety. Some experts argue that the law will de-legitimize the FDA and lead to patient harm. The FDAâ€™s primary mission is to protect patients and healthcare consumers from unsafe products.The Cures Actâ€”A Physician PerspectiveAs a practicing cardiologist, I rely on robust data to help me decide how best to treat my patients every single day. I trained at Duke University where we have the largest and most prolific center for the conduct of cardiovascular clinical trials in the worldâ€”the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI). I was taught to only use a drug or device that had been rigorously evaluated by RCTs and that all other data was insufficient to determine safety and efficacy. Observational studies can provide correlation but not establish a true â€œcause and effectâ€ù relationship. However, it is often frustrating when we hear about a potentially practice-changing drug or device that is available in Europe but NOT available in the US due to a protracted FDA process. The FDA is currently not adequately funded to handle the amount of regulatory and administrative work they must accomplish in order to efficiently evaluate drugs and devices in a way that still protects patients from harm. The Cures act does provide more funding to the FDA but it is far short of what the agency really needs. I do think that they agency can still ensure patient safety by shifting the way they look a drugs and devicesâ€”more needs to be done in the area of pharmacovigilence or post market drug and device monitoring. Possible novel mechanisms for this monitoring could be â€œsocial listeningâ€ù where artificial intelligence (AI) programs are used to sift through social media posts by patients in order to identify possible adverse drug or device events that may warrant investigation. Currently, the agency relies on self-reporting of these eventsâ€”leading to under-reporting and duplication of reportsâ€”making the data relatively unreliable.We must remember that the pharmaceutical and device industries are â€˜for profitâ€ù and that they pursue FDA approvals in order to sell their productsâ€”as with most businesses, when they can cut expenses (such as in research and development costs) they will do so. This law will certainly allow for more innovation at a lower cost but I worry that this law will do little to change the cost of drugs (think Mylan and EpiPen). Unless there is some provision for more Pharmaceutical regulation I suspect that this law will have little effect on drug costsâ€”it will help the bottom line of industry executives.The provision of the Cures Act that ensures funding of the NIH is incredibly important to researchers in health and science at academic institutions throughout the US.Much of the most important research that is conducted by medical schools and universities will be funded by the NIH and directed at finding cures for cancer and heart disease (just to name a few) through cutting edge genetic medicine.This funding is essential to advance science and develop new and exciting treatments for chronic diseaseâ€”without it, many projects will never come to fruition and many bright minds may leave institutions that are focused on research in science and medicine.Ultimately, I am pleased with the Cures Act. I think that it is important legislation that will help bring treatments to patients fasterâ€”saving lives and improving quality of life.We must, however, continue to balance promoting innovation with patient safety.We must also ensure that, as we move forward, that attention is given to monitoring the practices of the drug and medical device industriesâ€”we cannot allow price gauging and we must ensure that all patients have fair and affordable access to the latest and most effective therapies.Dr. Kevin Campbell is an assistant Professor of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, University of North Carolina and President, K-Roc Consulting LLC."foxnews,Pearl Harbor sailorâ€™s family brings him home after his remains are finally identified,"After decades of Pearl Harbor anniversaries, the family of Lewis Wagoner says this one will be more special than the rest.The Navy Seaman 2nd Class, one of the 429 onboard the USS Oklahoma who died during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack, is finally with his family in Kansas as his long-unidentified remains were tracked down and buried in October.â€œWe were so grateful that at last, after 75 years, that our uncleâ€_ and all of the whole family was just so excited that finally his remains had been brought home to rest,â€ù Lee Longaker, Wagonerâ€™s niece, told FoxNews.com.The story of Wagoner, who was 20 years old when he died at Pearl Harbor, is featured in a video produced by AARP to be released on Wednesdayâ€™s 75th anniversary.Born in 1921, Lewis Wagoner was one of eight boys growing up on his familyâ€™s farm in Whitewater. As a young child, he loved singing in his schoolâ€™s glee club and participating in sports like football, basketball and track and field, his nephew Mark Wagoner said.Around 10th grade, Lewis left school and stayed home to work with his dad on the family's farm, before joining the Navy and completing boot camp. He then was assigned to the USS Oklahoma and went to Hawaii, where he was stationed for war games in the Pacific.Related Image Expand / Contract Lewis Wagoner (AARP)From the day of the attack until 2015, his family never again knew the exact whereabouts of Lewis.As the ship was taking enemy fire from the Japanese, Wagoner jumped off the USS Oklahoma into fiery waters filled with oil and fuel, a shipmate who survived the attack said, according to Longaker. The shipmate had told the family that Lewis did not come back up from the water.In the aftermath of the attack, Wagonerâ€™s remains eventually were recovered and buried in Hawaii along with hundreds of other unidentified men from the ship.FULL COVERAGE OF THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PEARL HARBOR ATTACKLongaker told FoxNews.com that her family visited the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Oahu in 2011 and was told by the government there was a possibility that Wagoner was buried there.â€œIt was hard to see the unidentified headstones of these mass graves because they are people, they are a person, they are someone who is a member of a family -- someoneâ€™s daughter or son,â€ù she said in the AARP video. â€œI was glad to see there was something, but it was still empty as far as who is really there.â€ùIn the coming years, Longaker said her father made many phone calls and sent letters to the government to find out where they stood in terms of identifying Wagonerâ€™s remains.""Iâ€™ve always thought about Lewis, heâ€™s always been on my mind and it seemed like I could see him, I could see his body and remember it.â€ù - Carl Wagoner, Lewis' only living siblingThe breakthrough they were hoping for came in June 2015.Using modern forensic techniques to exhume the unidentified graves, the Defense POW/MIA accounting agency was able to identify Wagonerâ€™s remains with the help of DNA from the father of Lorna Davis, one of his nieces.Wagoner's remains are one of the 59 sets that have been identified so far out of the 388 from the USS Oklahoma that have been dug up, Staff Sgt.

During the alignment the sun, Jupiter, the moon and Saturn were all in Aries, according to Matthews, while Venus was next door in Pisces and Mercury and Mars were on the other side in Taurus. At the time, Aries was also the location of the vernal equinox.Matthewsâ€™ research notes that the presence of Jupiter and the moon signified the birth of a ruler â€œwith a special destiny.â€ù Saturn was a symbol of the giving of life, as was the presence of Aries in the vernal equinox, also marking the start of spring.

The addition of any one of these items would greatly increase the appeal of a space. Combine them all, and youâ€™d have one spectacular dream kitchen.1. Adequate lighting. Incorporating various types of lighting in any room is fundamental, but itâ€™s especially beneficial in the kitchen. An abundance of natural light is fantastic, but kitchens also need practical sources of artificial light: ambient lighting to create an overall glow, task lighting to illuminate workspaces and accent lighting to highlight features in the space.Brightening on a budget: Not ready for a lighting overhaul? Start by replacing your old bulbs with LEDs â€” they last longer, are more energy efficient and are available in cool, warm and neutral color temperatures. Undermounted LED rope lighting or puck lights are also affordable options for illuminating areas where cabinets cast shadows.2. Abundant seating. One of the biggest requests I hear as an interior designer is a need for more guest seating. People tend to congregate in kitchens, so make sure there is ample room for friends to gather in areas that wonâ€™t interfere with the functionality of your prep space.Round tables are a great way to provide easier traffic flow and can usually seat four to six people. Drop-leaf or extendable tables give you flexibility. They can be pushed against the wall out of the way when not in use or adjusted to create additional seating for entertaining guests. This is a good solution for a house that lacks a formal dining room.3. Surface area. A large island with lots of counter space and seating offers room for collaboration. Routine tasks such as paying bills, sorting through mail, doing homework or whipping up dinner can be executed without first having to move things around to make space. Having this clear surface also has a psychological effect that makes the home seem tidy even if other areas of the home are haphazard or covered with piles of items.No room for an island? Here are a few space-saving tips:When every inch counts, donâ€™t sacrifice surface area for the small stuff. Mount your paper towel holder to get it up and out of the way. Instead of using a knife block, store cutlery on the wall using a magnetic strip. Find a cutting board that fits over your sink or cooktop so that valuable counter space doesnâ€™t go to waste.Fold-down workstation surfaces are the Murphy bed of the kitchen. They give you extra space when you need it and are out of the way when you donâ€™t. Theyâ€™re also fairly inexpensive and easy to install.Or look to our next must-have kitchen accessory: the movable workstation.4. Movable workstation. An island on wheels, or even a bar cart, is great for cooking and entertaining. It provides more storage and a versatile surface area for prepping and serving.What to look for: Stainless steel is great because itâ€™s durable and easy to clean, or opt for the more affordable option, butcher block, for a different look and feel. When it comes to size, make sure you have about 36 inches between the edge of the island and surrounding countertops so as not to impede traffic flow. Depending on your preference, you can opt for counter height or bar height. Take note of whatâ€™s most comfortable before you head out shopping.5. Organized drawers. Divide and conquer! Save your time and sanity by keeping things neat and easy to find. Inserts and dividers add structure to drawers where loose items tend to pile up. Having designated spaces for all odds and ends will help you avoid overflow.When shopping for organizers, remember to first measure your drawers. Avoid cheap plastic options that warp over time, and instead search for something just as durable as the cabinetry.Utensil storage is key. Itâ€™s better (and cleaner) to neatly tuck away tools than to have a bouquet of spatulas sitting out on the counter.Shallow spice storage allows you to quickly see what you have rather than fumbling through a crowded cluster of jars. Bonus points if you move your spices from their original packaging into matching containers.Stack baking sheets and cutting boards vertically in deep drawers (if you have them) or narrow cabinets for easier access. Dividers will keep them upright. Donâ€™t forget to define separate cutting boards for produce, meats and breads.Organization for food storage containers always seems to be an afterthought (and one of the messiest parts of most kitchens). How many times have you reached for a piece of Tupperware only to find its corresponding lid has vanished? Cabinets eat loose lids, so keep them together. We prefer glass storage for food as it is microwaveable and stays in good shape longer.6. Pot and pan (and lid) organization. If you are able to grab a pot or pan and its lid without shuffling the rest of your cookware around, youâ€™re golden. Hanging them from hooks is a great way to achieve this feat and make efficient use of vertical space.7. Pullout corner storage. Clever cabinet organizers offer easier accessibility and help maximize the otherwise dead space where your Tupperware lids are probably hiding.You can find a multitude of products like this online or through your local cabinetry company, and most corner features can be retrofitted to your existing cabinetry.8. Dedicated appliance storage. Hidden storage for small appliances frees up counter space for more valuable uses.When designing your kitchen or remodeling cabinets, consider adding an appliance garage to keep your tools tucked away. Homeowners also can convert an existing cabinet by installing pullout shelves that offer quick and easy access to appliances when you need them. Whatever you do, assign a designated space for each gadget so they donâ€™t end up awkwardly stacked on top of the fridge or out on the counter.9. Sturdy hardware. Protect your cabinets with hardware. Over time, oil from hands can wear down the finish and dirty up or scratch the paint. Avoid unnecessary wear and tear with sleek pulls or knobs that will extend the life of your cabinetry. Look for a solid metal or something sturdy with substantial weight. It will benefit you â€” and your cabinets â€” in the long run.10. Citrus. When life gives you lemons, put â€™em to work. Whether youâ€™re adding a little zest to your meal, spritzing up a refreshing drink, loading up on vitamin C or just cleaning up the kitchen, citrus is a useful item to have on hand (plus, it displays well as a nice splash of color).Lemons and limes are great for organic garbage disposal cleanup. Running the rinds through with water helps to clean the blades, and the oils freshen up the scent. You can also concoct your own organic cleaning solution with lemon, baking soda and vinegar â€” just steer clear of marble countertops. The acid can cause staining and etching.11. Hand towels. Use decorative linen towels to reduce waste by using fewer paper towels. Not only are cloth towels more eco-friendly, they save you money and add a little charm to the kitchen.In addition to your pretty tea towels and cloth napkins, youâ€™ll want to keep a stack of cleaning towels or microfiber cloths on hand so theyâ€™re ready to grab when you need them. It will be less painful to forgo the convenience of paper towels if youâ€™re well-stocked for the next mess.12. A well-defined catch-all space. Daily life makes it impossible to have an organized home 24/7. Papers, keys, footwear, water bottles, bags and other various items tend to pile up quickly in certain areas. Avoid surface clutter by giving each of your things a designated home. Keys, mail, phone chargers and pens should all have a dedicated landing spot, whether itâ€™s a full-fledged, built-in command center, the back of a cabinet or organized space inside a closet.13. Enclosed trash and recycling. Trash bins take up floor space, can smell bad and are a source of mayhem for family pets. Hidden storage is optimal, but if you donâ€™t have that option, at least make sure your containers have lids. Keeping bins and bags together makes it easy to separate waste and recyclables.Cabinets can be retrofitted to house custom pullout containers, but if youâ€™re looking for an easy solution, check out popular retailers like The Container Store or Ikea for a variety of bins that will work to fit your existing space.14. Coffee station. Life is just a little bit easier when you have everything you need in one spot. If you can find a way to build it in or enclose it, even better. While a full-on coffee bar isnâ€™t always practical, having all your cafe accoutrements â€” coffee maker, grinder, beans or grounds, filters, mugs, sweeteners â€” in one dedicated place will simplify your morning routine.15. Character. Whether itâ€™s fun, colorful accessories or an unexpected piece of artwork, a kitchen should have an inviting atmosphere that allows for comfort, relaxation and good times.Play up your homeâ€™s interesting architectural details. If you have beautiful old glass-front cabinets, show off some colorful bowls or maybe some vintage glassware. Indulge in little accents, such as quirky doorknobs or vintage curtain tiebacks. These small details add fun, unexpected flair and personality."foxnews,"Cunard Line, P&O Cruises cancel all 2017 calls to Turkey","Turkey's tourism industry has been dealt some heavy blows in the wake of deadly terrorist attacks and an attempted coup this summer.According to Cruise Critic, Carnival Corporation's Cunard Line and P&O Cruises have both confirmed the cancellation of all calls to Turkey next year.""After careful consideration, we have taken the decision to remove Turkey from all itineraries in 2017 for both Cunard and P&O Cruises, based upon various sources including advice given by the U.K.â€™s Foreign and Commonwealth Office,"" the cruise lines said in a statement.Planned stops in Turkey will be replaced with calls in Greece and Albania.The news may disappoint travelers looking forward to enjoying some of Turkey's historic sites, Cunard and P&O aren't the first cruise lines to pull out of the troubled destination.Some cruise lines â€” including Disney Cruise Line, Crystal Cruises and MSC Cruises, among others â€” canceled calls in Turkey this year following a series of high-profile incidents.The U.S. State Department continues to warn Americans of ""increased threats from terrorist groups throughout Turkey.""""U.S. citizens should avoid travel to southeast Turkey and carefully consider the risks of travel to and throughout the country,"" the department said in a travel warning issued Oct. 29."foxnews,"Former astronaut, US Sen.

And scientists aren't entirely sure why.In an effort to learn more, researchers looked at meteorological factors related to tornado outbreaks , and then dug into the data to see whether these factors had changed over time, said study lead researcher Michael Tippett, an associate professor of applied physics and applied mathematics at Columbia University.The analyses did yield a result, but an unexpected one, Tippett said. [The Top 5 Deadliest Tornado Years in US History]""The meteorological factors that are related with tornado outbreaks have also become more extreme,"" Tippett told Live Science in an email. ""The surprising finding was that the change in meteorological factors did not have the expected signature of climate change.""That's not to say that climate change isn't involved, he said, but it does leave two possibilities: ""Either the recent increases are not due to a warming climate, or a warming climate has implications for tornado activity that we don't understand,"" Tippett said in a statement.Windy researchTippett said he became interested in tornadoes in the spring of 2011, when multiple deadly twister outbreaks struck the U.S. That includes the multivortex tornado that hit Joplin, Missouri , killing 158 people and injuring more than 1,000.""The public was asking what caused these record-breaking outbreaks, and scientists didn't have an answer,"" Tippett said.In the following years, Tippett and other scientists published studies on tornado clusters , a sequence of six or more tornadoes that happen within several days of one another. In the new study, Tippett and his colleagues found that the number oftwisters in the most extreme outbreaks has increased over the years, making these clusters more dangerous than in the past, he said.For instance, between 1965 and 2015, over five-year periods, the estimated number of tornadoes in the most extreme outbreaks (clusters with 12 or more tornados) roughly doubled, from 40 in 1965 to almost 80 in 2015, he said.Climate connection?To see whether this mysterious increase was connected to climate change , Tippett and his colleagues looked at two data sets from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), one that included tornado reports and another with observation-based estimates of meteorological factors associated with tornado outbreaks, he said.They were particularly interested in a factor called ""convective available potential energy"" (CAPE), the amount of energy available for convection in which hot, less dense material rises, and cold, dense material sinks. CAPE is related to the vertical wind speed, meaning that higher CAPE values indicate that severe weather will be more extreme, according to WeatherOnline.As the climate warms, CAPE is expected to increase, past studies have suggested, the researchers wrote in the study.However, CAPE has stayed fairly steady. Instead, ""we see trends in the winds,"" Tippett said. The wind metric he looked at, called storm relative helicity (SRH), is a measure of corkscrew-like upward winds, something that was not expected to increase with climate change, he said. [Tornado Chasers: See Spinning Storms Up-Close (Photos)]The finding is unexpected but important, said Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at NOAA's National Severe Storms Laboratory, who was not involved with the study.""The fact that they can explain the tornado changes by storm relative helicity changes is, in one aspect, not surprising (it's a much better predictor of whether a storm will make a tornado than CAPE is),"" Brooks wrote in an email to Live Science. ""But, in another aspect, [the results are] difficult to explain. We don't really have a good conceptual model for why high SRH values should increase as the planet warms.""Another viewpointThe study is ""intriguing,"" but it has several limitations, said Victor Gensini an associate professor of meteorology at the College of DuPage in Illinois.For starters, the study includes tornados only from 1979 to the present, which is a ""fairly short historical record,"" Gensini said in an email to Live Science. It's also possible that tornado reporting has gotten better over time, and that earlier records left out some tornadoes, he said.In addition, past studies have shown an increase in the variability of the U.S. tornado season, and climate models suggest that future severe weather will become more variable, Gensini said. But, in general, ""there are better environmental metrics to examine tornado environments that the authors failed to use here,"" he said. ""This is just one study, and people shouldn't hang their hat on one study.""The study was published online Dec. 1 in the journal Science .Original article on Live Science ."foxnews,Phoenix police release 911 call from man fired upon by serial killer,"Phoenix police released a 911 recording Wednesday from a man who walked away uninjured from attack by a man believed to have fatally shot seven people and wounded two others earlier this year in a wave of serial killings.The 22-year-old man told an operator on July 11 that a man in an early 1990s black BMW opened fire as he and his 4-year-old nephew were driving home. He said he ducked down with the child and kept driving once he saw the gun.""He was driving around the corner and then he just like literally pulled out a gun and just shot on me while looking at me,"" the man said, noting later that none of the shots hit him or his nephew.The 911 recording from the shooting â€” the last confirmed attack by the suspect known as the Serial Street Shooter â€” was released as police say the number of tips coming in from the public has dwindled at an alarming rate.The cases remain a high priority for investigators, police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said. ""We feel there are people who either know who this man is or (have) strong suspicions,"" Howard said. ""We need those people to reach out to us to share their suspicions.""Police say the victims were attacked as they stood outside their homes or sat in vehicles after dark. They were fired upon by someone who was sitting in a car or had just stepped out of a vehicle. All but one of the killings has taken place in the city's Maryvale section, a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood Phoenix's west side.Investigators believe the crimes were carried out by a lanky Hispanic man in his early 20s, but they are leaving open the possibility that someone else may have participated in the attacks. They don't believe the attacks are racially motivated. No motive has been established.The victims include a 21-year-old man whose girlfriend was pregnant with their son and a 12-year-girl who was shot to death along with her mother and a friend of the woman.The July 11 shooting didn't occur in Maryvale, but rather in another neighborhood about 10 miles away.The 22-year-old victim didn't see the suspect's license plate number, but he caught a glimpse of the shooter, describing him as a Hispanic man in his early 20s who had short black hair. ""He saw me because I was riding with the windows down,"" the man told a 911 operator.Investigators found three bullet holes on the victim's car and recovered five shell casings from the scene, a police report says.In all, authorities say they have received more than 3,000 tips about the shootings that happened between March and July.Investigators are continuing to analyze physical evidence recovered from the scenes, seek out neighbors who might have security camera footage of the shootings and work with community groups to seek out useful information, Howard said.Tips that have already been investigated are being handed off to other officers to be re-examined in hopes that a fresh set of eyes will turn up something new.There are several theories on why the killer hasn't struck in nearly five months, including that he has decided to stop the attacks, has been locked up in jail for other reasons or moved to another location, Howard said.""We won't know what really happened until we capture him,"" he said."foxnews,Apple responds to claims that multiple older iPhones have gone up in flames,"A Chinese consumer group that's ""loosely"" affiliated with the government said it has received eight reports from iPhone 6 users who own devices that have caught fire spontaneously. That's not the greatest news for Apple at this time, considering the iPhone battery performance issues it's already dealing with. But before you start to jump to conclusions, it's important to make it crystal clear that no, iPhones do not have a serious battery problem like the Galaxy Note 7.All battery-powered devices have a theoretical risk of explosion. It happens very infrequently with most devices, which is why it was immediately apparent that the Galaxy Note 7 has a more serious issue -- dozens of users reported unusual overheating and explosions immediately after the phone launched. Samsung ultimately had to admit defeat and cancel the handset two months after its release.According to The Wall Street Journal, Shanghai's Consumer Council is the group that issued the third battery-related complaint against Apple in China. The previous two concern spontaneous iPhone shutdowns even when there's still plenty of juice left in the device.Apple responded and stated that it has analyzed the affected iPhone 6 units and determined that the fires were caused by ""external physical damage."" The company also instructed customers to visit an Apple store or contact company support if they experience any issues with their iPhones.""We appreciate that customers are more concerned than ever about the performance and safety of batteries in their mobile devices,"" an Apple statement reads.Even so, Apple's battery troubles are far from over in the region. Earlier this week, Apple acknowledged that its iPhone 6s battery drain problem is more widespread than initially believed, saying that a software update might fix it. The company offers a free iPhone 6s battery replacement program, but it's not available to all iPhone 6s users in the region.Meanwhile, local consumer groups say that older iPhone models and iPhone 6s units not covered by the program are also affected by the same spontaneous shutdowns."foxnews,TIME's Person of the Year: Donald Trump,"The ChoiceBY NANCY GIBBS, Time MagazineThis is the 90th time we have named the person who had the greatest influence, for better or worse, on the events of the year. So which is it this year: Better or worse? The challenge for Donald Trump is how profoundly the country disagrees about the answer.Itâ€™s hard to measure the scale of his disruption. This real estate baron and casino owner turned reality-TV star and provocateurâ€”never a day spent in public office, never a debt owed to any interest besides his ownâ€”now surveys the smoking ruin of a vast political edifice that once housed parties, pundits, donors, pollsters, all those who did not see him coming or take him seriously. Out of this reckoning, Trump is poised to preside, for better or worse.For those who believe this is all for the better, Trumpâ€™s victory represents a long-overdue rebuke to an entrenched and arrogant governing class; for those who see it as for the worse, the destruction extends to cherished norms of civility and discourse, a politics poisoned by vile streams of racism, sexism, nativism. To his believers, he delivers changeâ€”broad, deep, historic change, not modest measures doled out in Dixie cups; to his detractors, he inspires fear both for what he may do and what may be done in his name.The revolution he stirred feels fully American, with its echoes of populists past, of Andrew Jackson and Huey Long and, at its most sinister, Joe McCarthy and Charles Coughlin. Trumpâ€™s assault on truth and logic, far from hurting him, made him stronger. His appealâ€”part hope, part snarlâ€”dissolved party lines and dispatched the two reigning dynasties of U.S. politics. Yet his victory mirrors the ascent of nationalists across the world, from Britain to the Philippines, and taps forces far more powerful than one manâ€™s message.We can scarcely grasp what our generation has wrought by putting a supercomputer into all of our hands, all of the time. If you are reading this, whether on a page or a screen, there is a very good chance that you are caught up in a revolution that may have started with enticing gadgets but has now reshaped everything about how we live, love, work, play, shop, shareâ€”how our very hearts and minds encounter the world around us. Why would we have imagined that our national conversation would simply go on as before, same people, same promises, same patterns? Perhaps the President-elect will stop tweetingâ€”but only because he will have found some other means to tell the story he wants to tell directly to the audience that wants to hear it.It turned out to be a failing strategy when Hillary Clinton, who loves policy solutions and believes in them, tried to make this race a character test, a referendum on Trump. But it was certainly understandable. He presented so many challenges, so many choices about what America values. Her popular-vote victory, while legally irrelevant, affirmed the prospect of a female Commander in Chief. ..."foxnews,Technology Photos,"Â©2016 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved.

Texas requires parents to approve immunizations, rather than mandating shots and having families opt out if they object to them.Some Texas state lawmakers said Wednesday they want to create a system where students who oppose immunizations would have to opt out of otherwise standard immunizations â€” and could only do so after watching a video on the medical effectiveness of vaccines.The most common immunizations protect against measles, mumps, and rubella, or German measles, as well as diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio and hepatitis A and B.Texas and 17 other states allow philosophical exemptions to vaccines. California used to let students forgo vaccinations for similar reasons â€” only to approve some of the country's strictest vaccine requirements last year. That law eliminated religious and personal beliefs as reasons for opting out of mandatory immunizations.The small group of Texas lawmakers that wants to make changes isn't planning to go that far when the GOP-controlled Legislature heads back into session Jan. 10.""The fact is that people have a choice to not immunize, but we need the herd effect,"" Rep. Donna Howard, an Austin Democrat who has filed an immunization ""opt-in"" bill, told reporters Wednesday. ""We need a significant number to be immunized to not only protect themselves but to protect the larger community.""Past efforts to improve immunization rates in Texas mostly have been stymied by opposition from conservative legislators who are immunizations skeptics, as well as a political group called Texans for Vaccine Choice. They point to discredited studies linking immunizations to health problems including autism.Texans for Vaccine Choice didn't respond to requests for comment Wednesday.Preparations for a legislative clash come amid a mumps outbreak south of Fort Worth, where immunization refusal rates in school districts are higher than the state average.Neighboring Arkansas has reported nearly 1,900 confirmed or suspected cases of mumps this year, though many of those involved children who got vaccines. That outbreak has nonetheless centered in an area where opt-out rates exceed those in other parts of Arkansas, according to that state's Department of Health. Like Texas, Arkansas allows parents to claim medical, religious or philosophical exemptions from school vaccination requirements.In Texas, nearly 45,000 kindergarten through 12th grade students reported filing conscientious exemptions to vaccinations last school year, which represents 0.84 percent of the number of students reported enrolled by schools in an annual survey, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. But as recently as the 2008 academic year, only about 12,600 public school students reported filing conscientious exemptions to immunizations, or 0.28 percent of that year's reported enrollment total.State Rep. Sarah Davis, a suburban Houston Republican who is sponsoring a proposal to mandate an online class for Texans who get non-medical exemptions to school immunizations, said that ""for some reason, there's a growing movement afoot to question the science and effectiveness of vaccines.""""Discredited research offered by discredited sources has nonetheless gained traction,"" Davis said Wednesday. ""It has created doubts in parents and uncertainty among the public. We're here because it's time to fight back."""foxnews,York: The Law Already Allows Donald Trump to Build the Wall,"By BYRON YORK | Washington ExaminerThere's no shortage of people telling Donald Trump he can't build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. And maybe, in the end, he won't do it. But at the moment Trump takes office, he will have the legal authority and the money he needs to get started on the wall. Yes, there will be obstacles â€” what's the over/under on the number of lawsuits that will be filed trying to stop it? â€” but the fact is, the law is already in place that will allow Trump to go forward.As in other areas of immigration enforcement, Trump will be able to effect radical change simply by following the law. In this case, it is the Secure Fence Act, passed in 2006 with bipartisan support â€” 283 votes in the House and 80 in the Senate, including then-Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.The law ordered the Secretary of Homeland Security, within 18 months of passage, to ""take all actions the secretary determines necessary and appropriate to achieve and maintain operational control over the entire international land and maritime borders of the United States."""foxnews,Feds Give Congress Blank Documents to 'Explain' Lab Data Manipulation,"By Ethan Barton | The Daily CallerU.S. Geological Survey (USGS) officials left Texas Republican Rep.

This may have come as a shock to the industry, who likely believed that theyâ€™d be given a free pass under a Republican presidency and Republican-controlled Congress. It is likely that on Election Day the Big Pharma companies prematurely let out a collective sigh of relief believing that a Republican-led government would never allow for imported medicines or for Medicare to negotiate drug prices, but it appears that the well-deserved panic is starting to set in.On the day Trump was named Time Magazineâ€™s â€œPerson of the Year,â€ù the publication released excerpts from a November interview in which he divulged plans to address out-of-control drug costs.â€œIâ€™m going to bring down drug prices. I donâ€™t like whatâ€™s happened with drug prices,â€ù he said.Those two lines, short enough to fit in a Tweet, sent shockwaves through the industry. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks took a hit, signaling that the relief they had been enjoying since Election Day was short-lived.They could have and should have seen this coming, as Trump has previously advocated for allowing cheaper pharmaceutical drugs manufactured abroad to be sold in the U.S. During his campaign, he also said allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies could save the agency $300 billion per year. While his savings number has been disputed, the cost-cutting measure aligns with what Democrats have peddled before, and he hasnâ€™t backed down yet.Where he will likely run into trouble is with Senate Republicans and the pharmaceutical industry itself, which has significant lobbying power in Congress. But where others before him have bowed to the pressure of medical industry titans, Trump will not. We recently watched Martin Shkreli, a hedge fund manager-turned pharmaceutical CEO raise a life-saving drugâ€™s price from $13.50 to $750 per pill. The public responded with outrage, and Trump called him a â€œspoiled brat.â€ù To her credit, Hillary Clinton criticized him too, but she was also accepting campaign funds from pharmaceutical executives.Shkreli cited the need to â€œturn a profit on the drugâ€ù for the hike, and while he may have come under the most criticism, he is certainly not the first in the industry to put profits before patients. According to prescription-benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co., from 2008 through 2014, average prices for the most widely used brand-name drugs jumped 128 percent. The industry chalks soaring costs up as a trade-off for all the money saved in preventing hospitalizations and illness-related complications. But even once in those hospital settings, something as simple as an Advil will cost significantly more when administered by a medical professional than if you picked it up at a local CVS, and thatâ€™s the industryâ€™s fault.If pretending that practicing preventative medicine is the tradeoff is what makes the industry heads sleep better at night so be it, but for the countless ill patients who cannot afford their medications, no price hike is justifiable. Really, whatâ€™s to blame here is the U.S. government for allowing such atrocities to occur in the first place. If a parent gave his 13-year-old keys to a Ferrari and then the teen crashes it, you donâ€™t blame the teen, you blame the negligent parent.Unlike civilized countries elsewhere in the world, the U.S. government does not regulate prices or partake in negotiations. Drug makers in the U.S. enjoy exclusivity in the marketplace under patents that last for 20 years, preventing healthy competition and the sovereignty of monopoly for a devastating period of time. Generic drug makers are often run out of the marketplace when brand-name medicines hit the shelves as it costs too much to try to keep up.A Wall Street Journal investigation found that compared to Norway, U.S. prices were higher for 93 percent of 40 top branded drugs available in both countries. It was similar in England and Ontario. A large difference between these countries and ours is the power of negotiation. In other countries drug companies are met with price caps and have to prove a drugâ€™s value in comparison to existing ones before getting cost approved.While opponents of government negotiating say it will discourage drug industry research and deny patients access to some medications, I ask them to consider if the alternative that we are living is really that much better. Our patients are already dying without proper medication because of soaring costs, and many causes are short on funding while marketing geniuses and those with good handshakes gobble up airtime and all the spending that comes with it. We need a change, and Iâ€™m hopeful Trump, the great negotiator, will champion it.Dr. Manny Alvarez serves as Fox News Channel's senior managing health editor.

Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangular shape of the phone and the layout of icons on the screen.At issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay ""total profit."" Apple said that means all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied.Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits.Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENTBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve.Samsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look.Samsung already has handed the $399 million over to Apple, but was hoping to get some of that money back with a favorable Supreme Court ruling. None of the early-generation Samsung phones involved in the lawsuit remains on the market.In a statement, Apple said the company is optimistic that lower courts ""will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn't right.""""Our case has always been about Samsung's blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute,"" the company said. ""We will continue to protect the years of hard work that has made iPhone the world's most innovative and beloved product.""A Samsung spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The patent battle between the technology titans was being closely watched by other industry giants. Companies including Google, Facebook and eBay sided with Samsung, arguing that the verdict was an excessive windfall for copying a few features of the iPhone.On the other side, sportswear manufacturer Adidas and jewelry maker Tiffany & Co. said allowing Apple to recover all the profits Samsung earned would discourage ""design pirates"" and protect companies that invest in creative designs.""This removes a threat for technology companies,"" said Janelle Waack, a Washington, D.C., lawyer specializing in patent law. ""The products that incorporate technology are not automatically going to get stung with a patent infringement suit that's going to cost them all of the profits from their product."""foxnews,Phoenix police release 911 call from man fired upon by serial killer,"Phoenix police released a 911 recording Wednesday from a man who walked away uninjured from attack by a man believed to have fatally shot seven people and wounded two others earlier this year in a wave of serial killings.The 22-year-old man told an operator on July 11 that a man in an early 1990s black BMW opened fire as he and his 4-year-old nephew were driving home. He said he ducked down with the child and kept driving once he saw the gun.""He was driving around the corner and then he just like literally pulled out a gun and just shot on me while looking at me,"" the man said, noting later that none of the shots hit him or his nephew.The 911 recording from the shooting â€” the last confirmed attack by the suspect known as the Serial Street Shooter â€” was released as police say the number of tips coming in from the public has dwindled at an alarming rate.The cases remain a high priority for investigators, police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said. ""We feel there are people who either know who this man is or (have) strong suspicions,"" Howard said. ""We need those people to reach out to us to share their suspicions.""Police say the victims were attacked as they stood outside their homes or sat in vehicles after dark. They were fired upon by someone who was sitting in a car or had just stepped out of a vehicle. All but one of the killings has taken place in the city's Maryvale section, a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood Phoenix's west side.Investigators believe the crimes were carried out by a lanky Hispanic man in his early 20s, but they are leaving open the possibility that someone else may have participated in the attacks. They don't believe the attacks are racially motivated. No motive has been established.The victims include a 21-year-old man whose girlfriend was pregnant with their son and a 12-year-girl who was shot to death along with her mother and a friend of the woman.The July 11 shooting didn't occur in Maryvale, but rather in another neighborhood about 10 miles away.The 22-year-old victim didn't see the suspect's license plate number, but he caught a glimpse of the shooter, describing him as a Hispanic man in his early 20s who had short black hair. ""He saw me because I was riding with the windows down,"" the man told a 911 operator.Investigators found three bullet holes on the victim's car and recovered five shell casings from the scene, a police report says.In all, authorities say they have received more than 3,000 tips about the shootings that happened between March and July.Investigators are continuing to analyze physical evidence recovered from the scenes, seek out neighbors who might have security camera footage of the shootings and work with community groups to seek out useful information, Howard said.Tips that have already been investigated are being handed off to other officers to be re-examined in hopes that a fresh set of eyes will turn up something new.There are several theories on why the killer hasn't struck in nearly five months, including that he has decided to stop the attacks, has been locked up in jail for other reasons or moved to another location, Howard said.""We won't know what really happened until we capture him,"" he said."foxnews,2 charged with aggravated arson in Tennessee wildfires,"Two teens were charged Wednesday with aggravated arson in connection to the deadly wildfires in the Gatlinburg region, The Tennessean reported.The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, District Attorney General James Dunn overseeing Sevier County and Great Smoky Mountains National Park announced the charges at a news conference Wednesday.Dunn said the juveniles face aggravated arson charges in the Chimney Tops area of Great Smoky Mountain National Park Nov. 23.The two are being held in the Sevier County juvenile detention center.""Our promise is that we will do every effort to help bring closure to those who have lost so much,"" said Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director Mark Gwyn.The juveniles are from Tennessee, but not Sevier County, where the fires spread. Otherwise, officials said state law prevents releasing more information about them.Karyssa Dalton, a 19-year-old whose grandmother Pamela Johnson remains missing in the blaze, told the Associated Press the two should be held accountable, even though they're young.""I mean, what if somebody came through their town, and set their town on fire, and lost their loved ones, and lost all their homes?"" Dalton said. ""It's not fair.""Great Smoky Mountains National Park Chief Ranger Steve Kloster said the public was ""critical"" in offering investigators information through a tip line. Previously, the National Park Service said it believed the fire was human caused, and set up a tip line for people to call if they hiked that trail on Nov. 23, or knew anyone who did.The investigation is ongoing and more charges could come. It's also possible that the case could be transferred to an adult criminal court, said local District Attorney General James Dunn.The juveniles are entitled to a detention hearing within 72 hours in which a juvenile court judge will decide to hold them without bond, hold them with bond, or release them, Dunn said.Dunn constantly said everything was ""part of the investigation"" when asked for details.Asked if others could be charged in the fire, Dunn repeated that ""everything's on the table.""""We don't know,"" he said.On Wednesday, Gatlinburg residents and business owners were allowed to move back into homes and establishments permanently. They had been allowed to visit during daytime hours since last Friday.The city is slated to open to the public on Friday morning. Though swaths of the city were decimated, the main downtown strip appears to have been spared.The Associated Press contributed to this report"foxnews,Washington Prepares For Trump's Executive Eraser,"By Alexis Simendinger, Real Clear PoliticsWith gusto, Donald Trump promises to unwind President Obamaâ€™s governance with the stroke of his presidential pen and the support of a GOP-controlled Congress.He can make good on those promises, but he will need to weather pushback from foes among the legislative branch, the courts, and voters and beneficiaries of Obama-era policies, plus world leaders who are wary of Trumpâ€™s worldview."foxnews,Nevada Congresswoman urges Trump to oppose call for online gambling ban,"Nevada Representative Dina Titus is urging the President Elect to oppose a call for an online gambling ban.The Democratic Congresswoman sent a letter to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, head of Trumpâ€™s transition team, this week. Her letter was in response to a letter signed last month by ten attorneys general who opposed online gaming.The ten Republican attorneys general sent their letter Nov. 17 to Pence asking him to consider the Restoration of Americaâ€™s Wire Act (RAWA). Nevadaâ€™s Attorney General, Adam Laxalt, was a cosigner of the letter.The Restoration of Americaâ€™s Wire Act is legislation that would effectively ban all online gambling nationwide with the exception of daily fantasy sports websites and horse race betting.In her letter, Titus contends that â€œthe letter submitted by the attorneys general contains several inaccuracies and unfair allegations.â€ù Titus touted regulations in place in Nevada, which she says prove online gambling can be effectively regulated. â€œGaming regulation in the state of Nevada is considered the international gold standard,â€ù she added.CYBERGAMBLING RETURNS â€“ AND THIS TIME ITâ€™S LEGALThe Restoration of Americaâ€™s Wire Act would rewrite and reinterpret the federal Wire Act of 1961, which is also known as the Interstate Wire Act.The AG letter cited addiction, divorce and increased suicide as harmful effects of online gambling. The AGs also raised concerns about anonymity, which they said could be used to support terrorist financing and criminal activity.However, in her letter, Titus warned of the ramifications that could arise from banning online gambling from states that are doing it correctly. She said, â€œI encourage you [Trump] to carefully study this issue before making any decisions that would infringe on stateâ€™s rights or eliminate jobs in the gaming industry.â€ùState-regulated online gambling is legal in Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey.The Restoration of Americaâ€™s Wire Act was introduced in the 2015 session of Congress and is still sitting in the Senate Judiciary Committee, according to Congress.gov. The legislation was written with the backing of Las Vegas hotel and casino billionaire, Sheldon Adelson, an opponent of online gambling."foxnews,9 wacky ways to see Santa Claus this year,"Going to see Santa at the mall is so old school.This year, opt for a more unique Santa sightingâ€”one thatâ€™s actually fun and active-- whether on a beach, a ski slope, city near home or somewhere youâ€™ve never been.

Apple falls into the latter camp, according to CEO Tim Cook, who says that the company just broke a record with Apple Watch sales.""Sales growth is off the charts,"" Cook told Reuters in an email message. ""In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.""Cook's rosy picture seems to fly in the face of a report just issued by research firm IDC , which says that Apple Watch shipments declined by 70 percent year-over-year in the third quarter. Cook's comments to Reuters were in response to a query about the IDC report.IDC claims that it's seeing a big shift in the overall wearables market, with more simple, single-purpose fitness trackers from Fitbit and others now making up a whopping 85 percent of the market.Can both companies be right? Sort of. The latest Apple Watch Series 2 and updated Series 1 didn't go on sale until mid-September, toward the end of the third quarter, and might not have had much impact on IDC's figures. Results from October through December won't show up until fourth-quarter numbers are available.Is the Apple Watch right for you? It depends on what you're looking for from a wearable device. Although it does a lot more than a simple fitness tracker, the Apple Watch Series 2 is best for those looking to get fit. It offers built-in GPS to track your runs and comes in a new swim-proof design you can easily take in the pool.Apple made some other notable improvements when moving from the Series 1 to the Series 2, including adding a faster processor, a brighter display and a beefier battery. But there simply isn't yet a killer app for the Apple Watch â€” or for any smartwatch. Notifications from your iPhone are helpful, and so is being able to pay with stuff with Apple Pay via your wrists, but you'll still want to use your smartphone for most tasks.Ramon Llamas, research manager for IDC's Wearables team, cited several challenges for smartwatches in the company's report and wrote that ""we need to see more intuitive user interfaces, seamless user experiences, standalone connectivity and applications that go beyond health and fitness and into personal and professional productivity.""The new Gear S3 from Samsung goes further than the Apple Watch buy offering optional 4G and a more stylish design, but as our own Mike Prospero wrote in his review, there simply aren't enough apps to choose from yet. The same IDC report said Samsung wearable sales â€” which includes more than smartwatches â€” were up 90 percent year-over-year.So, yes, the Apple Watch may be hot for now, but that doesn't mean it's right for you."foxnews,Michael Moore calls for protesters to 'disrupt' Trump's inauguration,"Michael Moore -- who predicted Donald Trump would win the presidency months before his surprise victory -- is now encouraging people to protest the President-elect's upcoming inauguration.""Disrupt the Inauguration.

But while Trump narrowly defeated Clinton in all three states, the numbers trickling in look unlikely to call into question the Nov. 8 results.â€œIn any election, the actual change in the margin of votes is very, very low,â€ù Drew Spencer Penrose, legal director at FairVote, told FoxNews.com. â€œFor people hoping for a change in results, I wouldnâ€™t hold my breath.â€ùHereâ€™s a rundown of what is happening in each state:Related Image Expand / Contract A worker looks over results during a statewide presidential election recount Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016, in Milwaukee.

(AP Photo/Morry Gash) (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)WisconsinWith the Wisconsin Election Commission working since last Thursday â€“ when Stein paid $3.5 million for the recount after alleging reports of fraud â€“ there has been little change so far to the unofficial results reported on Election Day. Trump won the state by 22,000 votes over Clinton.In a twist, Trump is gaining.By Wednesday morning, Trump had widened his victory margin over Clinton in Wisconsin by 146 votes, with 23 of the state's 72 counties having finished their recounts as of Tuesday. In those counties, Trump gained 105 votes and Clinton dropped 41 votes.Stein, who received about 1 percent of the vote in the states under question, said her intent was not to help Clinton, but to verify the accuracy of the count as she believed the votes were susceptible to computer hacking.â€œWeâ€™re not finding any problems with the machines,â€ù Reid Magney, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, told FoxNews.com. â€œThe Stein campaign wanted a recount because they thought there was some problems with our machines and that was not the case.â€ùWhatever Steinâ€™s reasons, it appears the recount has been more of a help than a hindrance to Trump, who saw the number of votes for him go up in several counties.In Green Lake County, which sits about 100 miles northwest of Milwaukee, the unofficial results from election night had Trump winning with 6,213 votes to Clintonâ€™s 2,701. The recount found that Trump actually received 6,216 votes while Clinton lost eight votes to finish with 2,693.And in those counties where Clinton picked up votes on Trump, Wisconsin officials said the number was not enough to influence the results.Related Image Expand / Contract Ballots are unloaded during a statewide presidential election recount in Waterford Township, Mich., Monday, Dec. 5, 2016.

The court noted that she received 1 percent of the vote and has no chance of catching Trump, who narrowly defeated Clinton in the state. A federal judge takes up the matter next.According to the certified results from late November, Trump won the state by about 10,700 votes â€“ or about two-tenths of a percentage point. The recount so far was looking at eight counties, including the stateâ€™s largest, Wayne.A controversy also is brewing in that county as officials said Tuesday that one-third of precincts could be disqualified from the recount because of problems with ballots.Wayne County â€“ home to Detroit â€“ overwhelmingly voted for Clinton late last month, but officials couldnâ€™t reconcile vote totals for 610 of 1,680 precincts during a countywide canvass of vote results. During the canvass, the number of ballots in precinct poll books did not match those of voting machine printout reports in 59 percent of precincts, 392 of 662.Related Image Expand / Contract Participants listen to a speaker at a rally at the Pennsylvania Capitol in support of a Green Party-backed quest for a recount of Pennsylvania's Nov. 8 presidential election, Monday, Dec. 5, 2016, in Harrisburg, Pa.

All rights reserved.)Michigan state law prohibits precincts whose poll books donâ€™t match with ballots from recounting votes.Despite the issue in Wayne County, experts say it will have little effect on the results in Michigan, or nationally.â€œThey are not going to affect the decision, but the discrepancy certainly warrants further investigation,â€ù Ned Foley, a professor of election law at Ohio State University, told FoxNews.com. â€œEven if it did change the results in Michigan, it still wouldnâ€™t matter because Clinton needed to win all three states to surpass Trump in the Electoral College.â€ùPennsylvaniaVerification measures have been taken in the Keystone Stateâ€™s two largest counties â€“ Philadelphia and Allegheny (home of Pittsburgh) â€“ but the fate of a statewide recount rests in the hands of a federal court after Steinâ€™s Green Party filed a federal lawsuit on Monday.While Pennsylvania has yet to certify its results from Novemberâ€™s election, an updated count by state election officials saw Trumpâ€™s lead shrink to just about 46,000 over Clinton out of the 6 million votes cast in the state.So far there have been very few reports of discrepancies in the recounts that have taken place.A re-examination of Allegheny County voting machine results did not change any votes and, in Philadelphia, Clinton gained only five votes after the City Commissioner's Office recounted votes in 75 of Philadelphia's more than 1,600 voting divisions in response to the recount appeal by more than 250 Philadelphia residents.These numbers are still shy of Pennsylvania's 0.5 percent trigger for an automatic statewide recount.The Associated Press contributed to this report."foxnews,"Syrian government troops, allied militiamen seize more ground in Aleppo","Syrian government troops and allied militiamen seized more ground in Aleppo's ancient quarters on Wednesday, further widening their control over an enclave in the divided city that has been in rebel hands since 2012, Syria's state media and an opposition monitoring group said.The state news agency SANA said the Syrian forces established control over two districts north of the Aleppo Citadel in the heart of the city â€” the Aghiour and Bab al-Hadid neighborhoods â€” after rebels abandoned positions and retreated further south.The new gains have choked the rebels, forcing them to pull back to other parts of the Old City, said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group that tracks Syria's civil war, now in its sixth year.Rebel defenses have collapsed rapidly in the face of a massive government assault backed by Russia and thousands of Iranian-backed Shiite fighters. On Tuesday, Syrian government forces captured Aleppo's centrally located al-Shaar neighborhood from the rebels, security nearly three quarters of the besieged enclave less than two weeks after launching their ground offensive.A map provided by the Syria army showed a quickly shrinking opposition enclaveâ€” a pointed leaf-shaped territory in the center, abutting already government-controlled Aleppo districts. The army media said the new gains bring the area controlled by the government in eastern Aleppo to about 73 percent of its original size, which is estimated to be about 45 square kilometers (17 square miles.)There was no immediate Syrian opposition comment on Wednesday's losses.Meanwhile, the Russian Defense Ministry said a Russian colonel who worked as a military adviser in the government-controlled part of the city of Aleppo has died in rebel shelling.The fatality marks Russia's third casualty this week, after two nurses were killed in a rocket attack on a makeshift Russian military hospital in Aleppo.

This may have come as a shock to the industry, who likely believed that theyâ€™d be given a free pass under a Republican presidency and Republican-controlled Congress. It is likely that on Election Day the Big Pharma companies prematurely let out a collective sigh of relief believing that a Republican-led government would never allow for imported medicines or for Medicare to negotiate drug prices, but it appears that the well-deserved panic is starting to set in.On the day Trump was named Time Magazineâ€™s â€œPerson of the Year,â€ù the publication released excerpts from a November interview in which he divulged plans to address out-of-control drug costs.â€œIâ€™m going to bring down drug prices. I donâ€™t like whatâ€™s happened with drug prices,â€ù he said.Those two lines, short enough to fit in a Tweet, sent shockwaves through the industry. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks took a hit, signaling that the relief they had been enjoying since Election Day was short-lived.They could have and should have seen this coming, as Trump has previously advocated for allowing cheaper pharmaceutical drugs manufactured abroad to be sold in the U.S. During his campaign, he also said allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies could save the agency $300 billion per year. While his savings number has been disputed, the cost-cutting measure aligns with what Democrats have peddled before, and he hasnâ€™t backed down yet.Where he will likely run into trouble is with Senate Republicans and the pharmaceutical industry itself, which has significant lobbying power in Congress. But where others before him have bowed to the pressure of medical industry titans, Trump will not. We recently watched Martin Shkreli, a hedge fund manager-turned pharmaceutical CEO raise a life-saving drugâ€™s price from $13.50 to $750 per pill. The public responded with outrage, and Trump called him a â€œspoiled brat.â€ù To her credit, Hillary Clinton criticized him too, but she was also accepting campaign funds from pharmaceutical executives.Shkreli cited the need to â€œturn a profit on the drugâ€ù for the hike, and while he may have come under the most criticism, he is certainly not the first in the industry to put profits before patients. According to prescription-benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co., from 2008 through 2014, average prices for the most widely used brand-name drugs jumped 128 percent. The industry chalks soaring costs up as a trade-off for all the money saved in preventing hospitalizations and illness-related complications. But even once in those hospital settings, something as simple as an Advil will cost significantly more when administered by a medical professional than if you picked it up at a local CVS, and thatâ€™s the industryâ€™s fault.If pretending that practicing preventative medicine is the tradeoff is what makes the industry heads sleep better at night so be it, but for the countless ill patients who cannot afford their medications, no price hike is justifiable. Really, whatâ€™s to blame here is the U.S. government for allowing such atrocities to occur in the first place. If a parent gave his 13-year-old keys to a Ferrari and then the teen crashes it, you donâ€™t blame the teen, you blame the negligent parent.Unlike civilized countries elsewhere in the world, the U.S. government does not regulate prices or partake in negotiations. Drug makers in the U.S. enjoy exclusivity in the marketplace under patents that last for 20 years, preventing healthy competition and the sovereignty of monopoly for a devastating period of time. Generic drug makers are often run out of the marketplace when brand-name medicines hit the shelves as it costs too much to try to keep up.A Wall Street Journal investigation found that compared to Norway, U.S. prices were higher for 93 percent of 40 top branded drugs available in both countries. It was similar in England and Ontario. A large difference between these countries and ours is the power of negotiation. In other countries drug companies are met with price caps and have to prove a drugâ€™s value in comparison to existing ones before getting cost approved.While opponents of government negotiating say it will discourage drug industry research and deny patients access to some medications, I ask them to consider if the alternative that we are living is really that much better. Our patients are already dying without proper medication because of soaring costs, and many causes are short on funding while marketing geniuses and those with good handshakes gobble up airtime and all the spending that comes with it. We need a change, and Iâ€™m hopeful Trump, the great negotiator, will champion it.Dr. Manny Alvarez serves as Fox News Channel's senior managing health editor.

They discovered microbes that live on human skin, as well as in places like bathrooms, kitchens, pillows, and evidence of food like chicken, fish, and mold from baked goods.â€œOur results suggest that ATM keypads integrate microbes from different sources, including the human microbiome, foods, and potentially novel environmental organisms adapted to air or surfaces,â€ù Jane Carlton, director of the Center for Genomics and Systems Biology at NYU and the senior author of the new study, said in a statement.The cash machines they studied were scattered across the city, from Manhattan to Queens to Brooklyn, and four of them were outside, although they didnâ€™t see anything different with those ATMs compared to the inside ones.RECORD-BREAKING BATS CAN FLY AS FAST AS 99 MPH, STUDY SAYSWhile the majority of microbes came from unknown sources, and then from surfaces like televisions or restrooms, they were also able to identify microbes that came from human skin, ears, noses, and feces.Interestingly, in places like midtown Manhattan, they found mold thatâ€™s connected with baked goodsâ€” called X. bisporus, the fungus is â€œassociated with spoilage of high-sugar foods such as cakes and confectionaries,â€ù according to the study.While the researchers can't be sure exactly where the mold came from, they have an idea: â€œit seems plausible that this fungus had been transferred from people who had recently handled baked goods, particularly in a commuter-heavy area such as midtown Manhattan, where there are many nearby convenience stores and cafÃ©s selling this type of food product to business workers,â€ù the researchers write in the study.Ultimately, the study, which was published in the journal mSphere, provides a snapshot of what people have been doing, as well as microbes that come from the urban environment.Follow Rob Verger on Twitter: @robverger"foxnews,"Meet LiLou, San Francisco airport's first therapy pig for stressed fliers","Traveling can be stressfulâ€”one needn't look further than lengthy TSA lines, meltdown-inducing delays, and overpriced tuna sandwiches to know just what we're talking about.In an attempt to help travelers quell some of that anxiety, San Francisco International Airport (SFO) has today introduced their latest team member: a small, spotted Juliana pig named LiLou who is famous enough to already have her own Instagram account, thankyouverymuch.LiLou is adorable, sure, but she's also making history. She's the first pig to be certified in the Animal Assisted Therapy Program of the San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and the first non-canine addition to the Wag Brigade, a group of 22 trained therapy dogs that roam SFO's terminals with â€œPet Me!â€ù vests.Though she'll roam the terminals like the other members of the brigade, Lilou is not just a one-trick...er, pig: She also performs a variety of show-stopping moves, including ""greeting people with her snout or a wave, twirling and standing up on her back hooves, and playing a toy piano""â€”even, USA Today reports, followed by a post-performance bow.SFO isn't the only airport using animals to help treat travel stress.More than 30 U.S. airports have ""therapy dog"" programs, while others, like Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, have been bringing in miniature therapy horses since last May.Looking for LiLou in particular? There's no set schedule as to when she'll show up, but airport spokesman Doug Yakel said SFO expects her to terminal-trot about once a month.(At present, a maximum of three canine members of the Wag Brigade can be found on duty in the terminals every day of the week.)If LiLou's Instagram is any indication, she may even be in disguise: In the past few months, the pig has dressed up as a wrapped gift, nurse, pilot, ballerina, and butterfly.At JFK, Animals Get Their Own Bathrooms"foxnews,A Republican Anti-Trump Elector â€“ Alan Colmes 12.7,You May Be Interested In...foxnews,"Trump poised to tap John Kelly for DHS, adding another general to team","Adding yet another general to his administration, President-elect Donald Trump is expected to tap retired Marine Gen. John Kelly as his choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security.Kelly told Fox News Trump already has asked him to serve in the DHS position.â€œI have been asked and would consider it an honor,â€ù he said.Kelly would be the third general Trump has picked for his administration, after announcing James Mattis â€“ who along with Kelly is a four-star general -- as his pick for Defense secretary. Trump also announced in November that retired Gen. Michael Flynn would be his national security adviser.Kelly retired from the Marine Corps earlier this year after leading U.S. Southern Command for three years, during which he was involved in the oversight of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay and the southern border.Kelly was picked by Defense Secretary Robert Gates to serve as his senior military adviser and then served in the same position under Leon Panetta before moving to Southern Command.Kelly complained at his last Pentagon press conference in January that after 40 years as a Marine he had the authority to watch drug dealers heading to the border by sea, but he could not disrupt them. He is believed to have a good relationship with current DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson, with whom he served as Pentagon general counsel.He served three tours in Iraq, and holds the somber distinction of being the most senior military officer to lose a child in combat in Iraq or Afghanistan. His son, Marine 2nd Lt. Robert Kelly was killed in November, 2010, in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.Known as an outspoken but loyal commander, Kelly will be first to lead the department who is not a lawyer and the fifth overall. The department was formed after the 9/11 terror attacks in order to help foil future attacks on the American homeland.Sources say Trump has settled on Kelly for the role, and is expected to name him in the next few days. Kellyâ€™s selection will require confirmation by the Senate.Immigration enforcement is a familiar issue for Kelly, and a big part of the DHS portfolio. Southern Command, which is based in South Florida, regularly works with DHS on missions to identify and dismantle immigrant smuggling networks. And it has partnered with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in an operation targeting human smuggling into the U.S. and helped with the rescue of children arriving alone at U.S. borders.While Trump has tapped military officials for key appointments, doing so can also bring complications. Gen. Mattis will need to secure a waiver from Congress in order to be considered due to a requirement that military officials be out of service for seven years before being secretary of Defense.Trump, meanwhile, said Wednesday that he has taken, and acted on, advice from President Obama on who he should appoint to various positions in his administration.â€œI have asked him what he would think of this one and that one,â€ù Trump said on NBC's ""Today"" show. â€œI would say that, yes, I take his recommendations very seriously and there are some people that I will be appointing, and in one case have appointed, where he thought very highly of that person, yes.â€ùWhile he did not go into specifics, he said that he likes Obama ""as a person"" despite the brutal criticism he leveled at the president on the campaign trail.""I will say this, I've now gotten to know President Obama. I really like him. ... I can't speak for him, but we have a really good chemistry together. We talk,â€ù Trump said.A coziness between current and former presidents is not unusual. President George H.W. Bush wrote President Bill Clinton a warm note when Clinton took office, while President Obama has repeatedly spoken of how accommodating President George W. Bush's team was to Obama in the lead-up to him taking office in 2009.Fox Newsâ€™ John Roberts and Jennifer Griffin and The Associated Press contributed to this report."foxnews,Pearl Harbor ceremonies take place across the nation,"It was a somber day Wednesday at the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum, where hundreds gathered to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the attacks on Pearl Harbor.The â€œday that will go down in infamyâ€ù hits especially close to home for former President George H.W. Bush, who was a senior in high school at the time. The gravity of what happened is what compelled him to temporarily forego his college plans and join the United States military.â€œWe gotta do something about this,â€ù recalled President Bush, in an op-ed article published by USA Today.Bush went on to become the youngest naval pilot of his time, commissioned just a few days before his 19th birthday. Then on September 2, 1944, the plane he was flying came under enemy fire and was hit. The former president managed to safely bail from his burning aircraft and was later plucked from a raft, in the middle of the sea, by the USS Finback, a lifeguard submarine.More than seven decades later, vintage WWII-era planes, just like the one Bush used to fly, soared over the crowd of spectators as part of the Pearl Harbor commemoration at his library in College Station, Texas.A moment of silence was also held at 11:55 Central time, or 7:55am in Hawaii, the exact moment the attack on Pearl Harbor began.The afternoon program included a panel, moderated by Brit Hume of Fox News.More than 20 World War II veterans were among the distinguished guests in attendance at the Bush Presidential Library â€“ including former Senator Bob Dole and Aaron Cook, the sole Pearl Harbor survivor in Wednesday's crowd.â€œI don't really know how to describe it,â€ù Cook said.Cook was just 19 at the time, and was working as a Chief Petty Officer in the US Navy, stationed on Ford Island. He remembers seeing the planes swoop in and unleash bombs.â€œIn retrospect, I'm glad I'm here. And I'm glad the country has survived,â€ù he explained.Now in his 90s, Cook said itâ€™s important to pay homage so that future generations can understand the significance of that day and a valuable piece of history simply isnâ€™t forgotten when he and his fellow troops are gone.â€œPeople just don't seem to be responsive. Kids go to sleep when you're talking to classes and they don't even know what Pearl Harbor is. They just don't realize how important it is,â€ù he added.To help educate and further inform the public about the significance of Pearl Harbor, a special exhibit has been set up at the President Bush Presidential Library and Museum, which will run through the end of this year.â€œWe began working on this about six months ago,â€ù said David Jones, CEO of the George Bush Presidential Library Foundation.â€œTwenty-five years ago President Bush spoke at the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, as the sitting president, and we have a copy of the speech in our auditorium here on a continuous loop,â€ù Jones said.There also is a digitally re-mastered version of President Franklin Delano Rooseveltâ€™s famed speech for spectators to view, with the words of comfort he offered to stunned-Americans after the attacks.Casey Stegall joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in 2007 and currently serves as a correspondent based in the Dallas bureau.

After brief deliberations, a three-commissioner panel voted to bar Winters-Johnson from the classroom for 12 years.Raina Lee, a lawyer who handles educator misconduct proceedings for the state, said it was the longest such sanction she'd seen. Mississippi has no legal provisions for permanently revoking a teacher's license, although department officials say they plan to ask lawmakers for that power.The move means Winters-Johnson can't even ask for her license back until the suspension is over, while the commission could have allowed the teacher to seek reinstatement after half the penalty.""Yes, you can wipe out 20 years of experience in a minute, 20 seconds, because it doesn't take but one,"" Lee told the commission, rebutting Winters-Johnson's pleas.A Washington County grand jury indicted Winters-Johnson on a misdemeanor charge of abusing a vulnerable person.Winters-Johnson tried to argue that videos watched by millions were only part of the story, begging the commission to balance the act against her long years of service. She said she was trying to prevent the student from harming herself and that parts of the video were misleading. Winters-Johnson testified she did not forcefully strike the student with a metal cup, saying she only brushed the student's head ""in an exaggerated motion.""""I was there and I know I didn't hit her with the cup,"" Winters-Johnson said.She told the panel that she would accept its decision, but her lawyer said she'd consider an appeal to the state Board of Education.The daylong hearing ended with a withering cross-examination of Winters-Johnson by Lee, after the teacher said she acted after the student had been jumping on bleachers, digging through Winters-Johnson's belongings, and leaning on an exit door.""Do you have any remorse for your actions?"" Lee asked at one point.""I do,"" Winters-Johnson replied.""Would you like to start sharing that with the commission?"" Lee responded.The hearing also showed Winters-Johnson might have gotten off lightly if the videos hadn't surfaced.Greenville High School Principal Xavier Hodo immediately recommended Winters-Johnson be fired, after a meeting where he said Winters-Johnson told him she only grabbed the student's hair ""playfully"" and that ""this technique had worked in the past"" to calm the student.District leaders overrode Hodo and first opted for suspension, and Winters-Johnson said she felt at one point the incident ""would go away."" Former Superintendent Leeson Taylor, fired because school board members were displeased by his response, testified that he feared Winters-Johnson would appeal a firing and win. Taylor said he might have chosen not to renew Winters-Johnson's contract after the school year.""This was a situation where Ms. Johnson did not feel she needed to accept responsibility for her action until the world knew about it,"" Lee said.Paula Vanderford of the state Department of Education characterized the investigation as ""ongoing,"" meaning administrative charges could be filed against others. One question is whether any Greenville school employees deleted videos of Winters-Johnson's actions. The district also failed to report the incident to the state within the required 10 days.___Follow Jeff Amy at: http://twitter.com/jeffamy .

Chappell and the driver of the MTA bus died. Four passengers on the MTA bus were also killed and 11 more sustained injuries.A teachers aide was on the bus with Chappell during the Nov. 1 accident and told investigators that she asked the driver what happened after he initially hit the Mustang. The woman, who was not identified, said Chappell didn't respond and the bus careened into the transit bus shortly thereafter.Chappell had been driving buses since 2008. He began working for AAAfordable in 2014, but took a break between April and August of this year, during which time he drove for other bus companies.The NTSB report found that neither bus driver was using a cell phone or had been driving for long hours prior to the crash. There also appeared to have been no mechanical issues with either bus.The Associated Press contributed to this report."foxnews,"On the 75th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, looking at young names on marble markers","This morning, a cacophony of U.S. Navy warships, some gliding stately up and down the main channel, others gently tugging at their moorings, wafts across the waters of Pearl Harbor.But one ship never moves. The battleship USS Arizona lies below the murky waters of the harbor, its decks submerged, its armaments missing or askew. A telltale trail of oil â€” symbolic blood â€” still seeps from its sides three-quarters of a century after it was lost.The Arizona is an icon of devotion and sacrifice. More than 900 men lie entombed below its decks. Yet it is difficult to escape the surrounding bustle that encroaches upon the reverence this final resting place deserves.A few miles away and 500 feet above the harbor, in a volcanic crater called the Punchbowl, things are very different. Here, the loudest sound is that of silence itself. There are few visitors. Across the flat floor of the bowl, a carpet of green grass accents rows and rows of white marble markers. After the quiet, the most moving thing about this place is the dates on the graves.So many of those buried here were born within a few years of one another â€” the late 1910s and early 1920s. They were not called baby boomers then, but they had indeed been conceived in the aftermath of World War I by parents who were hopeful of what lay ahead. But the dates on which so many of them died reveal that a hopeful future did not come to pass: 1942, 1943, 1944, and repeatedly December 1941, December 1941, December 1941, and most often December 7. Who were these men? What happened that day?Among the 2,403 American servicemen who died 75 years ago at Pearl Harbor, 1,177 were crewmembers of the Arizona. Those who lie buried in the Punchbowl Crater at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, and their shipmates and friends still resting in the hull of the Arizona in the harbor, thought Dec. 7, 1941, would be like any other day. It wasnâ€™t.Their sacrifices became the defining memory marker of a generation â€” much as 9/11 would become for later generations.Everyone of age to understand would always remember where he or she was when the news crackled out of a radio or spread across the front page of a newspaper.The day before, America had been divided; many held strong isolationist views. But in two hours on a quiet Sunday morning, Japanâ€™s surprise attack on the American fleet united the country as never before.Pearl Harbor became a numbing low point of national shock and tragedy, but also a galvanizing moment that embedded a will to win at any cost in Americaâ€™s national psyche.We honor those who gave their lives 75 years ago but we also remember the contributions and sacrifices of those who answered the call.Over the next four years, 10 million American men and women served in the armed forces of the United States. The youngest veterans of those years are now approaching 90 years of age or beyond.In the twilight of their years, so many of their sharpest memories seem to be of that time long ago, when they were fresh-faced teenagers giving their all to a common purpose. Much has been written about their leaders, but their individual efforts made the difference.This yearâ€™s commemoration of the attack on Pearl Harbor begins the last roll calls of the World War II generation at the places these men and women made sacred: today at Pearl Harbor; Midway and Guadalcanal; Kasserine Pass, Anzio and Normandy; Bastogne, Okinawa and more in the years to come.They have been called the greatest generation, and rightly so. But we also remember that there are other dates on white markers in American cemeteries across the country and around the globe. The young names attached to them tell of other generations who also gave the last full measure: in Korea and Vietnam, and too recently in Iraq and Afghanistan.Perhaps the greatest lesson from Pearl Harbor and the generation that lived through it is that nothing is impossible. They were a â€œcan-doâ€ù generation. They did not take â€œnoâ€ù for an answer. They did not put off what needed to be done.On this 75th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, we honor their memory, remember their resolve and strive to live up to their example.Historian Walter R.

And all those pieces about how to survive Thanksgiving when one of your relatives might be crazy enough to be a Trump voter. And fashion designers who expressed their disgust by announcing that they would not provide any outfits for Melania Trumpâ€”that one worthy of a New York Times story.And we all know what happened with â€œHamilton.â€ùYes, it seems thereâ€™s a fertile media market for people speaking out about how Trumpâ€™s election has ruined their lives, is ruining the country, and possibly could ruin western civilization. Forget about Taiwan or Carrier or flag-burning, all they have to do is put together a personal rant to win their 15 seconds of fame. Editors are, well, rather receptive.It helps if youâ€™re already famous. Take Madonna, who at one event offered to sexually service any man who voted for Hillary. Now Billboard magazine quotes its â€œWoman of the Yearâ€ù as saying the following about Trumpâ€™s victory:â€œIt felt like someone died. It felt like a combination of the heartbreak and betrayal you feel when someone you love more than anything leaves you, and also a death. I feel that way every morning; I wake up and say, â€˜Oh, wait, Donald Trump is still the president,â€™ and it wasnâ€™t a bad dream that I had. It feels like women betrayed us. The percentage of women who voted for Trump was insanely high.â€ùWhy is that?â€œWomen hate women,â€ù says the Material Girl.What other explanation could there be?But the absolute winner in this blame-Trump has to be Stephanie Land. Never heard of her? Neither has anyone else.But the Washington Post saw fit to give the Missoula, Mont. woman a platform to spew about the president-elect ... though what sheâ€™s saying isnâ€™t exactly clear.The single mom starts out by saying she was going on as many as six dates a week to try to find a partner. A couple of dudes were emerging as finalists.But then: â€œOnce it was clear that Donald Trump would be president instead of Hillary Clinton, I felt sick to my stomach. I wanted to gather my children in bed with me and cling to them like we would if thunder and lightning were raging outside, with winds high enough that the power might go out. The world felt that precarious to me.â€ùSo were her potential boyfriends Trump backers? Nah. But one felt â€œtoo unfamiliarâ€ù and Land wanted to focus on her friends.â€œâ€˜I canâ€™t,â€™ I told him. â€˜I just canâ€™t.â€™ Iâ€™ve lost the desire to attempt the courtship phase.â€ùAnd thatâ€™s it. Poor Stephanie is depressed, so she doesnâ€™t feel like dating, and itâ€™s all Trumpâ€™s fault for messing things up.

So this is a stunt that will have no impact on Trump taking office.Suprun has lots of grievances. He says Trump lacks foreign policy experience. He quotes Alexander Hamilton. He says that â€œMr. Trump goes out of his way to attack the cast of â€˜Saturday Night Liveâ€™ for bias.â€ù He says GOP electors should unite behind, say, John Kasich, who only won his home state.With all due respect, who cares what he thinks?This whining by Trump-haters is becoming a market niche.

And maybe, in the end, he won't do it. But at the moment Trump takes office, he will have the legal authority and the money he needs to get started on the wall. Yes, there will be obstacles â€” what's the over/under on the number of lawsuits that will be filed trying to stop it? â€” but the fact is, the law is already in place that will allow Trump to go forward.As in other areas of immigration enforcement, Trump will be able to effect radical change simply by following the law. In this case, it is the Secure Fence Act, passed in 2006 with bipartisan support â€” 283 votes in the House and 80 in the Senate, including then-Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.The law ordered the Secretary of Homeland Security, within 18 months of passage, to ""take all actions the secretary determines necessary and appropriate to achieve and maintain operational control over the entire international land and maritime borders of the United States."""foxnews,FoxNews.com - Breaking News,foxnews,House of Representatives approves bill to mint coins for moon landing 50th,"The United States Mint is now somewhere between a ""small step"" and a ""giant leap"" closer to striking coins for the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing.The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday voted unanimously to pass the ""Apollo 11 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act,"" calling for the Mint to produce curved coins in gold, silver and clad to recognize the five decades since astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins launched on the first lunar landing mission.The bill (H.R.2726) was passed under a suspension of the rules used to quickly approve non-controversial bills. The act was first introduced by Congressman Bill Posey (R-FL) in June 2015.""Mr. Speaker, July 20, 2019 will mark the 50th anniversary of the landing of the 'Eagle' lunar module on the moon's surface,"" Posey, who was a member of the Apollo team in 1969, said on the House floor on Monday. "" We remain the only country that has ever launched humans [to] the moon and returned them safely to Earth.""This commemorative coin will celebrate what I feel is the most awe-inspiring engineering and technological [feat] of the 20th century,"" said Posey.Joining Posey as the initial cosponsors for the bill were representatives Frederica Wilson (D-FL), John Culberson (R-TX), Gene Green (D-TX) and Rod Blum (R-IA). The bill attracted the support of 293 more cosponsors before being passed on Monday.Should the bill pass in the Senate before the end of the year and the President sign it into law, then the U.S. Mint will be directed to strike convex coins bearing the iconic image reflected in Buzz Aldrin's helmet visor, as was taken by Neil Armstrong on the moon.""The design on the common reverse of the coins minted under this act shall be a representation of a close-up of the famous 'Buzz Aldrin on the moon' photo taken July 20, 1969, showing just the visor and [a] part of the helmet of astronaut [Aldrin], in which the visor reflects the image of the United States flag and the lunar lander,"" the legislation instructs.That design would be further highlighted by the shape of the commemoratives.""The coins minted under this act shall be produced in a fashion... so that the reverse of the coin is convex to more closely resemble the faceplate of the astronaut's helmet of the time,"" the bill directs.The act calls for the coins to be issued in four legal tender denominations:â€¢ $5 gold coins - not more than 50,000 pieces, with a diameter of 0.85 inches (2.16 centimeters);â€¢ $1 silver coins - not more than 400,000 pieces, with a diameter of 1.5 in. (3.8 cm);â€¢ Half-dollar clad coins - not more than 750,000, with a diameter of 1.25 in. (3.2 cm);â€¢ Proof-silver $1 coins - not more than 100,000, with a diameter of 3 inches (7.6 cm).Each of the coins, regardless of metal, will feature a front (obverse) design chosen by a juried competition overseen by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consulting with the Commission of Fine Arts and being viewed by the Citizen's Coinage Advisory Committee, which suggested the Apollo 11 theme in 2014.Proceeds from the Mint's sale of the Apollo 11 coins would benefit the Astronaut Memorial Foundation and Astronaut Scholarship Foundation's science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) programs, as well as the Smithsonian's ""Destination Moon"" gallery opening at the National Air and Space Museum in 2020.The coins' sale would also offset the cost of their minting, such that they are produced at no cost to taxpayers.The Mint previously recognized the moon landing by using the Apollo 11 mission's official patch as the reverse design on the Eisenhower and Susan B. Anthony dollars issued from 1971 to 1981. The Mint also struck the New Frontier Congressional Gold Medal presented to Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins (and Mercury astronaut John Glenn) in 2011.Copyright 2016 collectSPACE.com.

Here are eight places where container plants can bring style and good cheer to your home.1. Above the sink. As with most things in decorating, there is a minimalist and a maximalist approach to decking your halls with holly and houseplants. On the minimalist end of the spectrum is hanging a few small pails across a tension rod in your kitchen as a makeshift herb garden. The mounting hardware can be had on the cheap from your local hardware store, and all you need are a few grocery store seedlings and a sunny window to freshen your kitchen with the scent of aromatic herbs.2. Around the home office. All the necessary electronics of our working lives can make for a dismal office space. One solution is to fill the room with plants. Hanging them means you can retain more of your desk space for productivity.3. Hanging from the ceiling. In a white room with warm wood, a few strategically placed plants provide all the personality and color thatâ€™s needed. Indeed, plants offer an easy design solution that also promotes interaction with natural life via watering and plant tending.4. Above a potting station. Donâ€™t forget that an indoor or outdoor potting shed can be kept verdant even when there is no potting being done. My favorite idea for dressing a potting area for year-round use is to bring in a space heater and chair and make it double as a retreat for reading or napping. Without plants, though, it will just be a plain, cold room, so keep that green thumb working.5. Where you dine. Plants have long been a staple of bohemian-style decorating. The budget-conscious adherents to this design philosophy appreciate the remarkable ability of plants to transform a space all on their own, and for relatively little money. When paired with elegant, traditional details such as a high-quality antique table, a sparse, white interior populated by hanging plants can feel downright upscale.6. Along a hallway. Loading up on hanging plants is one of the most visually impactful ways to decorate a long hallway.7. Above the tub. As I prepared to put my house on the market, I struggled with how to address an awkward corner of our small, generic bathroom to give it some life and add interest in a way that would be neutral enough for potential buyers. The solution: two brimming plants hanging from the ceiling. If youâ€™re fortunate enough to have a free-standing tub, you might use a hanging plant in a similar manner.8. Attached to a trellis. A vine-covered trellis is as delightful indoors as out. Some vines can thrive in any light and with minimal watering, making them a great option for indoor use. Find a place to secure a potted vine to a wall or suspend the plant in a hanging basket with a trellis to cling to, and once youâ€™ve trained and pruned it into position, itâ€™ll only need minimal care to fill out the space."foxnews,Dr. Kevin Campbell: The Cures Act could speed up FDA approvals. Will you still be safe?,"This past week, the House of Representatives passed legislation that has become known as the 21st Century Cures Act. Wednesday, the Senate also passed the Act.This is thought to be the largest and most powerful healthcare related law since the passage of the Affordable Care Act during Obamaâ€™s first term.The Cures Act provides for a large increase in funds for boosting biomedical research and also takes aim at speeding up drug and medical device approvals through the Federal Drug Administration (FDA).As expected, other items are also placed inside this bill such as funding for Opioid abuse as well as a program to better treat mental illness as well as research funding for ObamaCareâ€”making it very likely that President Obama will sign the measure that contains 6.8 billion dollars in funding now that it has also been approved by the Senate.In spite of opposition by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders the bill passed and is likely to find its way to President Obamaâ€™s desk very soon.There appears to be widespread support of the bill in the scientific community particularly amongst those that are involved in medical innovation and research.Many medical researchers have worried about what may happen to important and essential research funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under a Trump administration and this new law would provide for more that 4 billion dollars for the NIH over the next decade. The NIH supports some of the most important medical and healthcare research in the world.How Might This Law Affect the FDA Process?Currently drug and device makers must present data obtained from rigorous randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs). Often RCTs require years to complete and involve the enrollment of thousands of patients. RCTs â€“because these trials prove cause and effect--provide the best type of evidence for the safety and efficacy of a drug or device. Under the new law, companies would be able to use â€œsurrogate endpointsâ€ù rather than hard outcomes to obtain approvalsâ€”this would make it far less expensive and time consuming for pharmaceutical and device companies to move new products through the FDA at a much quicker pace. Company controlled registry data would be accepted as evidence and RTCs would not always be required. In addition, observational dataâ€”which statistically shows â€œassociationâ€ù but does not prove â€œcause and effectâ€ùâ€”will also be considered by the FDA during the approval process. During the last year, lobbyists have flooded Congress on behalf of drug and device makers in order to promote the passage of the CURES act . Pharma as well as the device industry stand to realize huge gains if it becomes law.What Could This Mean for Health Care Consumers?Proponents of the legislation argue that this will be a huge step forward in public health. By providing such a large amount of funding for biomedical research as well as funding for work on opioid addiction and mental health treatments, that are likely to provide better treatment options for millions of Americans. In addition, simplifying the FDA approval process is likely to spur innovationâ€”companies will be able to devote more time to research and development and patients will be able to reap the benefits of new therapies much faster. The FDA process is currently weighed down with lots of rules and regulationsâ€”providing a clearer path to approval may encourage smaller innovators and entrepreneurs to produce new products.Opponents to the law argue that removing the requirement for robust data with hard endpoints to support the safety and efficacy of new drugs and devices may place patients at risk. Consumer and public safety groups worry that the law may open the door to the approval of unsafe drug and device approvals. Using observational data and patient feedback rather than RTCs may allow unsafe drugs and devices to enter the market; Companies may be incentivized to rush drugs and devices to the market with only anecdotal evidence in support of their efficacy or safety. Some experts argue that the law will de-legitimize the FDA and lead to patient harm. The FDAâ€™s primary mission is to protect patients and healthcare consumers from unsafe products.The Cures Actâ€”A Physician PerspectiveAs a practicing cardiologist, I rely on robust data to help me decide how best to treat my patients every single day. I trained at Duke University where we have the largest and most prolific center for the conduct of cardiovascular clinical trials in the worldâ€”the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI). I was taught to only use a drug or device that had been rigorously evaluated by RCTs and that all other data was insufficient to determine safety and efficacy. Observational studies can provide correlation but not establish a true â€œcause and effectâ€ù relationship. However, it is often frustrating when we hear about a potentially practice-changing drug or device that is available in Europe but NOT available in the US due to a protracted FDA process. The FDA is currently not adequately funded to handle the amount of regulatory and administrative work they must accomplish in order to efficiently evaluate drugs and devices in a way that still protects patients from harm. The Cures act does provide more funding to the FDA but it is far short of what the agency really needs. I do think that they agency can still ensure patient safety by shifting the way they look a drugs and devicesâ€”more needs to be done in the area of pharmacovigilence or post market drug and device monitoring. Possible novel mechanisms for this monitoring could be â€œsocial listeningâ€ù where artificial intelligence (AI) programs are used to sift through social media posts by patients in order to identify possible adverse drug or device events that may warrant investigation. Currently, the agency relies on self-reporting of these eventsâ€”leading to under-reporting and duplication of reportsâ€”making the data relatively unreliable.We must remember that the pharmaceutical and device industries are â€˜for profitâ€ù and that they pursue FDA approvals in order to sell their productsâ€”as with most businesses, when they can cut expenses (such as in research and development costs) they will do so. This law will certainly allow for more innovation at a lower cost but I worry that this law will do little to change the cost of drugs (think Mylan and EpiPen). Unless there is some provision for more Pharmaceutical regulation I suspect that this law will have little effect on drug costsâ€”it will help the bottom line of industry executives.The provision of the Cures Act that ensures funding of the NIH is incredibly important to researchers in health and science at academic institutions throughout the US.Much of the most important research that is conducted by medical schools and universities will be funded by the NIH and directed at finding cures for cancer and heart disease (just to name a few) through cutting edge genetic medicine.This funding is essential to advance science and develop new and exciting treatments for chronic diseaseâ€”without it, many projects will never come to fruition and many bright minds may leave institutions that are focused on research in science and medicine.Ultimately, I am pleased with the Cures Act. I think that it is important legislation that will help bring treatments to patients fasterâ€”saving lives and improving quality of life.We must, however, continue to balance promoting innovation with patient safety.We must also ensure that, as we move forward, that attention is given to monitoring the practices of the drug and medical device industriesâ€”we cannot allow price gauging and we must ensure that all patients have fair and affordable access to the latest and most effective therapies.Dr. Kevin Campbell is an assistant Professor of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, University of North Carolina and President, K-Roc Consulting LLC."foxnews,Trump Is Becoming 'King of America' and the News Media Is Playing Along,"By John Ziegler | MediaiteIn our communal effort to now try to figure out what kind of president Donald Trump will be (an endeavor which has traditionally, until this year, been undertaken BEFORE a presidential election has been completed), it seems there has been a lot of misdirected focus. It appears that, especially on the left, most of the concern is that he will turn into a racist dictator of some sort.However, the left, as they so often do, is not only overplaying their hand with regard to who Donald Trump is, but they are also missing the primary point almost entirely. While I understand how someone who bought into the leftâ€™s â€œalt-rightâ€ù â€œwhite supremacistâ€ù caricature of Trump might see his authoritarian â€œlaw and orderâ€ù language as real warning signs of the rise of a Hitler-like figure (did you know that they were both named Timeâ€™s â€œPerson of the Yearâ€ù?), I think this conclusion requires a fundamental misunderstanding of who Trump is.Whether he even fully realizes it himself, I see Trump as carving out a new role of â€œKing of Americaâ€ù for himself. Judging from his first month as â€œpresident-elect,â€ù it is very clear that the Trumpian view of the presidency is much more in line with that of the early 20th Century British monarchy than how our founders conceived of the position of commander in chief (heck, have you seen his living quarters in Trump Tower?!)."foxnews,FoxNews.com - Breaking News,foxnews,6-foot-wide 'bald' asteroid is smallest ever studied,"Astronomers have set a new record, taking the measure of a tiny space rock just 6 feet wide.The researchers used four different telescopes on Earth to study the near-Earth asteroid (NEA), which is called 2015 TC25, during a close flyby it made of the planet in October 2015.""This is the first time we have optical, infrared and radar data on such a small asteroid, which is essentially a meteoroid,"" Vishnu Reddy, of the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, said in a statement.""You can think of it as a meteorite floating in space that hasn't hit the atmosphere and made it to the ground â€” yet,"" added Reddy , lead author of a new study published in The Astronomical Journal that reports the 2015 TC25 observations. (But the chances of the asteroid hitting Earth in the foreseeable future are small, he said.)Reddy and his team found 2015 TC25 to be surprisingly bright, reflecting about 60 percent of the sunlight that hits it. The asteroid also rotates once every 2 minutes, making it one of the fastest-spinning NEAs ever observed, researchers said.In addition, 2015 TC25 appears to be a chunk of solid rock, rather than a rubble pile like many bigger asteroids. The tiny asteroid also consists of essentially bare rock; it lacks the layer of dirt-like regolith that blankets its larger brethren.""Detecting this on 2015 TC25 means all small asteroids might be bald and dust-free,"" Reddy said in a different statement.The asteroid was discovered in October 2015, shortly before its Earth flyby, which brought the space rock within just 79,500 miles of the planet's surface. (For comparison: The moon orbits Earth at an average distance of 239,000 miles.)2015 TC25 is a NEA that circles the sun once every 382 days. But Reddy and his team think a collision probably chipped the space rock off 44 Nysa, a 43-mile-wide asteroid that resides in the main belt between Mars and Jupiter.""If we can discover and characterize asteroids and meteoroids this small, then we can understand the population of objects from which they originate: large asteroids, which have a much smaller likelihood of impacting Earth,"" Reddy said.The researchers studied 2015 TC25 using the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility in Hawaii, the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, the Magdalena Ridge Observatory in New Mexico and the Lowell Observatory/Discovery Channel Telescope in Arizona."foxnews,Cavuto Confronts Stein Over Recount: You 'Pick and Choose' Which States to Sow Doubts In,"By Josh Feldman | MediaiteFoxâ€™s Neil Cavuto faced off with Jill Stein this afternoon over her recount efforts and why sheâ€™s focusing on just three states that Hillary Clinton happened to lose.He repeatedly pressed her on why she picked those specific states and not, say, any that Clinton won.

He said he ducked down with the child and kept driving once he saw the gun.""He was driving around the corner and then he just like literally pulled out a gun and just shot on me while looking at me,"" the man said, noting later that none of the shots hit him or his nephew.The 911 recording from the shooting â€” the last confirmed attack by the suspect known as the Serial Street Shooter â€” was released as police say the number of tips coming in from the public has dwindled at an alarming rate.The cases remain a high priority for investigators, police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said. ""We feel there are people who either know who this man is or (have) strong suspicions,"" Howard said. ""We need those people to reach out to us to share their suspicions.""Police say the victims were attacked as they stood outside their homes or sat in vehicles after dark. They were fired upon by someone who was sitting in a car or had just stepped out of a vehicle. All but one of the killings has taken place in the city's Maryvale section, a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood Phoenix's west side.Investigators believe the crimes were carried out by a lanky Hispanic man in his early 20s, but they are leaving open the possibility that someone else may have participated in the attacks. They don't believe the attacks are racially motivated. No motive has been established.The victims include a 21-year-old man whose girlfriend was pregnant with their son and a 12-year-girl who was shot to death along with her mother and a friend of the woman.The July 11 shooting didn't occur in Maryvale, but rather in another neighborhood about 10 miles away.The 22-year-old victim didn't see the suspect's license plate number, but he caught a glimpse of the shooter, describing him as a Hispanic man in his early 20s who had short black hair. ""He saw me because I was riding with the windows down,"" the man told a 911 operator.Investigators found three bullet holes on the victim's car and recovered five shell casings from the scene, a police report says.In all, authorities say they have received more than 3,000 tips about the shootings that happened between March and July.Investigators are continuing to analyze physical evidence recovered from the scenes, seek out neighbors who might have security camera footage of the shootings and work with community groups to seek out useful information, Howard said.Tips that have already been investigated are being handed off to other officers to be re-examined in hopes that a fresh set of eyes will turn up something new.There are several theories on why the killer hasn't struck in nearly five months, including that he has decided to stop the attacks, has been locked up in jail for other reasons or moved to another location, Howard said.""We won't know what really happened until we capture him,"" he said."foxnews,"Dow, S&P Hit Highs; Trump Comment Hammers Drug Stocks","Wall Street surged on Wednesday, with the Dow industrials and S&P 500 hitting fresh records, as equities continued their march upward after the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, and a new high for transportation stocks added to the bullish tone.Continue Reading BelowAll three major indexes finished more than 1 percent higher.The gains came even as Trump's comments on prescription drug pricing wounded the healthcare sector.U.S. equities have scaled new highs since the election, with investors encouraged by Trump's plans for economic stimulus and to reduce corporate taxes and regulations.""I think it's continuation of the view that the new administration will be pro-business,"" said Ernie Cecilia, chief investment officer of Bryn Mawr Trust in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 297.84 points, or 1.55 percent, to 19,549.62, the S&P 500 gained 29.12 points, or 1.32 percent, to 2,241.35 and the Nasdaq Composite added 60.76 points, or 1.14 percent, to 5,393.76.Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENTThe S&P 500 set a new closing high for the first time since Nov. 25.The Dow Jones Transport Average rose 2.5 percent and set new all-time intraday and closing highs, surpassing its prior peaks from late 2014.A finish above the closing record for the transportation average could indicate further gains as it triggers a bullish sign for some investors who look for parallel performance for both the Dow industrial and transportation averages.""You're going to have these (software) programs that are now going to say Dow Theory has been confirmed and they then initiate buy orders, which creates more fuel for the fire,"" said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O'Neil Securities in New York.Gains were broad-based with 10 of 11 major sectors in positive territory.A $3-billion trading program to buy a broad spectrum of stocks also came into the market in the afternoon and ""really just sparked this market to move higher and higher,"" said Jonathan Corpina, senior managing partner for Meridian Equity Partners, an equity and options broker-dealer in New York.Telecommunications and real estate, which are high dividend payers, posted the strongest sector gains.""There's a little bit of a bond market rally going on, certainly in the long end, so that means dividend stocks feel better,"" said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago.Traders also pointed to covering of short positions ahead of Thursday's meeting of the European Central Bank as a catalyst driving the market higher.Trump's victory has been seen as a boon, particularly for financial and industrial stocks that have surged since the election.But biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks tumbled on Wednesday after Trump promised in a Time magazine article that ""I'm going to bring down drug prices.""The S&P healthcare fell 0.8 percent, the only group in negative territory.

But new laws across the nation are rolling the rules back -- and lawmakers think theyâ€™re holding a royal flush.Mega-entrepreneur Richard Bransonâ€™s Virgin Group is the latest entry in online gambling, teaming with the Tropicana Resort in Atlantic City and online game maker Gamesys to bring online poker, blackjack and slots to New Jersey this week. Gov. Chris Christie validated the vice in the waning weeks of 2013, saying he hoped to rake in $1 billion in casino revenues this year, of which the state will collect a 17 percent tax.And New Jersey isnâ€™t alone; eight other states have bills in the works that will allow Internet gambling as well. Nevada and Delaware also began offering some online gambling last year, but New Jersey is the first state to â€œfullyâ€ù legalize it, said Lee Fenton, the chief operating officer of Gamesys.â€œThere will be many games to play online in New Jersey,â€ù Fenton told FoxNews.com. â€œBlackjack, slots. Not just poker.â€ù'Last year, before a single state authorized legal online gaming, Americans spent nearly $3 billion.' - Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the American Gaming AssociationPlayers must be at least 21 years old, and either reside in New Jersey or be in the state when they place their bets. They play against the house at Virgin Casino, and they can finance their wagers with debit cards, credit cards, or in person.â€œThose from other states can play, but they cannot wager,â€ù Fenton said. â€œThe technology is rolling out this week.â€ùTo prevent unauthorized access, Virgin Casino physically locates gamersâ€™ cellphones periodically. â€œIf we are unable to determine that you are in New Jersey, you will be unable to play on Virgin Casino,â€ù the site notes. If your phone is off, or if youâ€™re too near state borders, you may not be allowed to play.What happens online, stays onlineSix other firms, including popular companies like WSOP.com and Ultimate Poker and other casinos like Caesars and the Golden Nugget, participated in the â€œsoft playâ€ù launch of online gambling in New Jersey in November, the stateâ€™s Department of Gaming Enforcement Director Dave Rebuck said during a recent conference call.Not everyone agrees with the odds. Virgin could be holding a full house, but it could also fail before the flop.â€œIt'll be interesting to see how this plays out,â€ù said Laurence DeGaris, associate professor of marketing at the University of Indianapolis and an expert in Internet culture.â€œSlots and roulette are very visceral games, lots of bells and whistles. That doesn't translate online,â€ù DeGaris told FoxNews.com. â€œBlackjack and poker have a very human element that's lost online. In online casino gambling, it's about the game more than the bet.â€ùBut analysts are mostly rolling with Christie and the casinos. U.K. market research firm H2 Gambling Capital, which focuses on the gaming industry, predicted about $300 million for New Jerseyâ€™s online casinos â€” or about $45 million in tax revenue, according to the New York Times. Others predict the overall U.S. market could be worth as much as $9 billion in the coming years as other states, including California, legalize online wagering.Globally, the business is even more lucrative. H2 said the industry was worth $33 billion in 2013, with $4.5 billion coming from mobile gambling on iPads, iPhones and smartphones.Prohibition failed â€“ againLast month, the president and CEO of the American Gaming Association testified before Congress and urged legislators to repeal their 7-year-old ban on Internet gambling.â€œProhibition simply does not work,â€ù Geoff Freeman told a House panel on Dec. 10. â€œThe federal government has tried the prohibition approach â€“ specifically the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 and the Wire Act â€“ and through multiple Justice Department crackdowns on offshore operators as well.â€ùMany Americans simply ignored the ban, he noted, as the country did during Prohibition in the â€™20s.â€œLast year, before a single state authorized legal online gaming, Americans spent nearly $3 billion on illegal, unregulated offshore gaming sites. To put that into further context, Americans accounted for nearly 10 percent of the entire $33 billion worldwide online gaming market,â€ù Freeman said.Legalizing gambling across the U.S. will generate â€“ in addition to tax revenue from the proceeds at casinos â€“ approximately 22,000 new online gambling-related jobs, Freeman testified.Freeman said the Department of Justice has relaxed its views toward online gambling since 2011, and this could open up even more opportunities in the U.S. -- notably sports betting.â€œIn sports gambling, it's about the bet,â€ù DeGaris said. â€œThat's where I see the huge potential in online gambling, and I reckon the U.S. will catch up to the rest of the world and allow it at some point.â€ù"foxnews,Denzel Washington Blasts Media for Selling 'BS',"By Judy Kurtz, The HillHe was at the center of a fake news story, but Denzel Washington says it's the mainstream media that's selling ""BS.""""If you don't read the newspaper, you're uninformed.

But that's exactly what unfolded on the Senate floor Wednesday as two Democrats went to the mat to force the Senate to cut a better health care deal for coal miners.Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.,and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, both vulnerable senators facing re-election in 2018, took to the Senate floor to block a host of bills and resolutions that usually sail through unnoticed.Manchin and Brown want a longer guarantee of health benefits for miners beyond April 28. The miners' health care issue has emerged as a flashpoint on a bill to fund the government through next spring. Funding for the government expires Friday night.Sen. Thom Tillis, R-NC, repeatedly tried to get clearance from Manchin and Brown on a panoply of non-controversial bills Wednesday night. But the Democrats repeatedly objected, effectively blocking each item.At one point, Tillis tried to advance a measure observing the 75th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Stunningly, Brown objected as he and Manchin had done on all other measures.Brown said on the Senate floor, ""They're like resolutions that don't mean anything. But they're nice. But they don't mean anything to a widow..(who won't get health care).""Brown said,"" I suppose we could go all night. I don't mind working late tonight.

What Ike and JFK might tell President-elect Trump,"On January 19, 1961, under the threat of a storm that would dump eight inches of snow on Washington D.C., President Dwight Eisenhower held a final transition meeting with his young successor, John F. Kennedy. One day before the inauguration, Eisenhowerâ€™s mind was on the looming threats to American security, and Cuba was high on that list.Writing about this critical moment in U.S.-Cuban relations in my new book, â€œThree Days in January: Dwight Eisenhowerâ€™s Final Missionâ€ù (out from William Morrow on January 10, 2017), I was struck by the parallels between then and now, especially as we grapple with the implications of the death of Fidel Castro.Related Image Expand / ContractThen, at the height of the Cold War, the threat posed by a Soviet-backed dictator off our southern coast was grave, and the need to formulate the right response in a nuclear age was a grave concern for Eisenhower.On the campaign trail during the 1960 presidential election, Kennedy had been bullish about dealing with and confronting Castro. Now Ike wanted to give him a more measured perspective.If Eisenhower were advising President-elect Trump today, he would likely suggest, as he did with Kennedy, that the best way to approach such a complex matter as Cubas was to proceed cautiously, to hold his cards close to his vest, and to strategize in private.In a cabinet meeting following their private discussion, Kennedy learned the details of a plan in development under the auspices of the CIA to train Cuban exiles for a potential invasion of Cuba. The aim was to overthrow Castroâ€™s brutal regime. But, Ike stressed, the plan was only in the early stages, and certain conditions would have to occur if it had any chance of successâ€”including the creation of a government in exile and a strong leader who was capable of replacing Castro. Kennedy listened respectfully, but he mostly ignored Ikeâ€™s caveats. Kennedy was impatient with the process Ike favored, which involved extensive debates from national security advisers. He preferred a looser, more shoot-from-the-hip style, and relied on a couple of key men who had his ear. In the case of Cuba, the absence of sound advice had disastrous consequences.Within three months of becoming president, Kennedy approved a poorly planned invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs by a disorganized group of exiles. When he withdrew critical air support, Castroâ€™s forces easily swept in and killed or captured the exiles. It was a complete failureâ€”and Kennedy knew it. â€œHow could I have been so stupid?â€ù he raged.In desperation he turned to Eisenhower. On April 22 he sent a helicopter to bring Ike from his home in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania for a private consult at Camp David. As the two men strolled along the wooded paths, Kennedy lamented, â€œNo one knows how tough this job is until heâ€™s been in it a few months.â€ùEisenhower smiled wryly. â€œMr. President,â€ù he replied softly, â€œif you will forgive me, I think I mentioned that to you three months ago.â€ù And indeed he had. But Kennedy, bursting with confidence, hadnâ€™t taken him seriously.Kennedyâ€™s Bay of Pigs fiasco unleashed the rage of Castro and emboldened the Soviet Union to begin erecting missile sites in Cuba pointed at the United States. The Cuban Missile Crisis, over half a century ago, remains Americaâ€™s most chilling encounter with an immediate nuclear threat.Once again, Kennedy turned to Ike. In a tape recording of their conversation on file at the JFK Library, one can hear the nervous uncertainty in Kennedyâ€™s voiceâ€”and the unruffled calm in Eisenhowerâ€™s. Kennedy knew he had to act, even if it meant attacking Cuba and removing the missile sites by force. But he was worried about making a fatal mistake. â€œWhat about if the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, announces tomorrow, which I think he will, that if we attack Cuba, that itâ€™s going to be nuclear war, and whatâ€™s your judgment as to the chances theyâ€™ll fire these things off if we invade Cuba?â€ù he asked Eisenhower.Ike, the old warrior who had stared down Hitler as commander of the allied forces in World War II, saw through the bluster of our enemies. â€œSomething may make these people shoot â€˜em off,â€ù he said. â€œI just don't believe this will.â€ù Reassured, Kennedy went on to negotiate the removal of the missile sites, and did it without having to attack Cuba. But it was a very close call.Today, the wounds from the conflicts of the early 1960â€™s remain exposed and painful. When President Obama opened relations with Cuba in May of this year, six in ten Americans supported normalization. But for many others, especially in South Florida, the atrocities of Castroâ€™s regime cannot so easily be forgotten, and its future commitment to freedom for its people is not so clear.In conversations during the transition, Eisenhower told Kennedy that the easy decisions a president faces are handled by staff. Only the impossible ones fall on the president himself.President-elect Trump will likely find that to be true as well, and Cuba is a good example. As president he will oversee the beginning of the post-Fidel Castro era, with all the complexity that entails. The decisions he makes early in his term could shape our relationship with the island nation for decades to come. He has already signaled his intention to renegotiate President Obamaâ€™s deal and perhaps even terminate it, but no matter what his strategy it will have significant consequences.If Eisenhower were advising President-elect Trump today, he would likely suggest, as he did with Kennedy, that the best way to approach such a complex matter was to proceed cautiously, to hold his cards close to his vest, and to strategize in private.In particular, Ike would have advised bringing voices from all sides into the room--those who agreed with the president and those who did not--and letting them engage in a rigorous debate.We donâ€™t know what could have changed if President Kennedy had listened to Ikeâ€™s same advice at the time.More than five decades later, without the looming Soviet nuclear threat, a President Trump has an opportunity to steer a new course in U.S. Cuba relations.Tuesday, the Obama administration sent Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes and U.S. Ambassador to Cuba, Jeffrey DeLaurentis to attend a memorial service for Fidel Castro in Havana. The administration insisted it was not â€œhonoringâ€ù the dictator, who executed thousands of Cuban citizens and persecuted many more, because they didnâ€™t send â€œan official delegationâ€ù to the ceremony.White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters about the move, â€œWe believe that this was an appropriate way for the United States to show our commitment to an ongoing future-oriented relationship with the Cuban people.â€ùNo matter which path the 45th president chooses when it comes to Cuba, one can be assured, it will be different in some way to the path the 44th president has pursued.Bret Baier is the Chief Political Anchor of Fox News Channel, and the Anchor & Executive Editor of ""Special Report with Bret Baier.â€ù His book, ""Three Days in January: Dwight Eisenhowerâ€™s Final Mission,"" published by William Morrow, will be released on January 10, 2017."foxnews,New Zealand quake's strange side effect: What are earthquake lights?,"The magnitude-7.8 earthquake that rattled New Zealand early Monday morning local time (Sunday morning EST), killing at least two people and stranding many others in the region, also had a strange side effect: eerie blue and green flashes of light in the sky during the shaking.Only in recent years have seismologists taken reports of these so-called earthquake lights seriously. It turns out that researchers still don't fully understand the phenomenon, but they do have a few clues about where and why it occurs.The strange light shows â€” which may appear as sizzling flames emanating from the ground, flashes of lightning, ghostly globes or blue and green shimmers â€” usually occur at rifts where huge chunks of Earth are pulling away from each other, according to a 2014 study published in the journal Seismological Research Letters. [Elves, Sprites & Blue Jets: Earth's Weirdest Lightning]Also in 2014, researchers showed that shifting grains surrounding a fault may generate an electrical charge, though exactly why this happens is poorly understood.Unexplained phenomenonObservers have documented shimmering earthquake lights more than 60 times over the past several centuries. In 2009, for instance, before a major earthquake struck L'Aquila, Italy, bystanders reported what looked like flames sizzling from the sidewalk, and in Canada's Yukon Territory in the 1970s, ghostly green orbs that were floating in the sky were initially thought to be UFOs but were later determined to be tied to a nearby quake. But until recently, many researchers discounted these reports as hearsay.""Earthquake lights are totally underreported,"" Friedemann Freund, a crystallographer (someone who studies the atomic structure of materials) at NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, and San Jose State University, previously told Live Science. ""They are often things that happen within a fraction of a second.""But with the widespread availability of smartphones, these strange events are now being documented more frequently.In 2014, Freund and his colleagues showed that 97 percent of earthquake lights documented since the 1600s occurred at faults that were within continental plates, rather than at subduction zones, where one plate is diving beneath another. They found that 85 percent of the incidents occurred where Earth buckles and creates a steep ravine or drop in the Earth. This fissure allows magmatic rocks that originate deep belowground to gradually migrate up toward the surface, where they discharge energy. Because of how the atoms in these rocks are organized, they may generate an electrical charge more easily, flow upward to the surface, ionize the air and generate the light show, the researchers speculated.In this scenario, earthquake lights may not even be tied to earthquakes. Changes in stress at a fault can occur either due to a catastrophic rupture or because of a slower release over days, and both forms could generate an electrical charge that ionizes the air, according to the research.""Crackpot physics""In a separate study detailed at the 2014 American Physical Society meeting in Denver, researchers filled Tupperware containers with mixtures of plastic discs, glass particles and powders, such as flour, and watched what happened as they stuck and slipped past one another. These mixtures were meant to mimic the way grains of Earth move in an earthquake zone.The researchers found that the mixtures reliably generated high voltages when tipped, even though they could not explain why.""Except for the fact that we cannot get these voltages to go away, I would call this 'crackpot physics,'"" Troy Shinbrot, an applied physicist at Rutgers University in New Jersey, previously told Live Science. ""And even as it is â€” I wish I could hedge my bets, but the voltages are very repeatable, and we have so far failed to account for a spurious influence that might cause them.""Original article on Live Science.Editor's Recommendations"foxnews,Hilary Duff and Jason Walsh -- Hot Mexico Vacation,"Ricky Martin -- Beefcake Beach ...

When Monroe County deputies arrived, the law enforcers snapped a picture of the group.The migrants were turned over to Customs and Border Protection. All 13 are said to be in good health.Castroâ€™s death on Nov. 25 was apparently not enough to keep the migrants in Cuba. â€œThe death of Fidel â€” no. We came here to better our lives, work and fight and help our parents,â€ù said Jose Ramon Mestre, one of the migrants. â€œWe have nothing against him.â€ùTuesday night, 7News cameras captured the migrants as they got out of a bus that pulled up at Church World Service in Doral, where they will be processed and released.The images of Cuba during nine days of mourning showed thousands of people grieving, but at least a handful of Cubans were making plans to leave, seeking freedom.The migrants told 7News they have family in the U.S. and were looking to reunite with them. Because they made it to land, they will most likely be allowed to stay.For more Miami stories visit www.fox7news.com.Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram"foxnews,News,foxnews,Sporty Spice Mel C flashes chiseled abs in topless photo on Instagram,"All those Sporty Spice workouts are paying off!

Investigators have not found evidence of arson, but she said they have also not ruled it out.Snyder did not give a timeline for the completion of the investigation.Officials hope to create a virtual, 3D reconstruction of the building for criminal and civil investigations and to provide answers to family members about their loved ones' last moments, Alameda County sheriff's Sgt. Ray Kelly said.""Where was my son or daughter? Where were they standing? How come they didn't get out?"" he said. ""Families want answers. They need answers.""The fire broke out during a dance party Friday night in the cluttered warehouse.The structure had been converted to artists' studios and illegal living spaces, and former denizens said it was a death trap of piled wood, furniture, snaking electrical cords and only two exits.Danielle Boudreaux, a 40-year-old hairdresser who was close with Derick Ion Almena, the founder of the artists' colony, and his partner, Micah Allison, said it was full of extension cords plugged into each other that helped supply power to music equipment, microwaves and hot plates.There were also RVs inside, she said.Almena has not responded to emails or calls by The Associated Press to phone numbers associated with him. He has said he didn't attend the event Friday night, and he is sorry.City and state officials fielded complaints for years about dangerous conditions, drugs, neglected children, trash, thefts and squabbles at the warehouse, raising questions about why it wasn't shut down. The district attorney has warned of possible murder charges as she determines whether there were any crimes linked to the blaze.The fire has cast a spotlight on similar artists' colonies around the San Francisco Bay Area that offer cheap housing in one of the country's priciest rental markets but have raised safety concerns among neighbors and city officials.Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said the city will look to strengthen regulations for smoke alarms and exits and clarify city employees' responsibilities to monitor unsafe structures.She said the city has been flooded with complaints about building safety since the fire and she wants to engage the arts community in the review to ensure any changes don't jeopardize their access to affordable housing and work space.On Wednesday, an Oakland restaurant owner, Dorothy King, called a news conference to say she was concerned the artists' warehouse next to her business could pose a safety hazard.Several artists tried to shout her down, accusing her of launching a ""witch hunt"" that could result in artists' collectives being shut down.King said that wasn't her intention.""I'm concerned about my business burning down.

The iconic American brand has announced it will be donating the doors from Sam Waltonâ€™s first Arkansas outpost to Smithsonianâ€™s National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.Sam Walton opened his first Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Ark. in 1945. After being in business for five years, Walton had to relocate when his landlord refused to renew his lease. According to the Walmart Museum, Walton relocated the store to Bentonville, and within the first year he was commanding impressive six-figure sales.Related Image Expand / Contract The original Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Ark. in 1945. (Photo courtesy of The Walmart Museum)After the Arkansas store proved successful, Bud Walton, Samâ€™s brother, opened a second outpost in Ruskin Heights, Mo., a Kansas City suburb. In 1962, Sam Walton opened his first eponymous Wal-Mart after successfully managing nine Ben Franklin stores. At the time, offering low priced goods in rural communities was the main company focus.Today, Walmart operates over 11,000 stores in 28 countries, under 60 different brands names.SURPRISING FACTS ABOUT WALMART FOODYet despite its major global presence today , artificats from the early days of Walmart are few and far between, says Alan Dranow, the director of the Walmart Museum.â€œWe had absolutely no artifacts, nothing from that store because nobody held onto them,â€ù Dranow told FoxNews.com. â€œNobody knew that Walmart was going to be what Walmart became or that Sam was going to become what he became.â€ùEnter the doors from the very first Ben Franklin store.Related Image Expand / Contract Photo courtesy of The Walmart Museum (Visitors take in an exhibit at the Walmart Museum in Bentonville, Ark. )According to Dranow, the doors were kept for decades in a warehouse by Gene Ivy, co-owner of the Arkansas-based contractor Ivy Brothers Construction. The company was charged with renovating Waltonâ€™s first store in Newport in the 1960s-- and the original doors have been kept in storage since then.Ivy kept the doors in his garage after he retired. When he died in 2014, one of his grandchildren contacted a Walmart employee about what to do with salvaged store relics. The Walmart Museum, which first opened in 1990 as the Walmart Visitor Center, was more than happy to take in the prized store relics this summer.But Dranow admits the doors have seen their share of wear and tear.""Because Waltonâ€™s store was so popular he had more traffic than anybody. The door is worn on the side where you push to get in,â€ù Dranow told FoxnNews.com. â€œTheyâ€™re not really in great condition. Basically they were just stored and never touched.â€ùOne door will live in Bentonville, and a second will soon be relocated to a place where millions of Americans can take in a bit of Walmart history every year-- the National Museum of American History in the nationâ€™s capital.

Dubbed Tongtianlong limosus, the winged creature had died after becoming mired in mud about 66â€“72 million years agoâ€“ hence itâ€™s nickname, the â€˜Mud Dragon.â€™Before the wellâ€“preserved and nearâ€“complete skeleton was discovered, it had been damaged by dynamite while workmen were excavating a school near Ganzhou. Luckily, the workers found it before any more damage had been done.â€œThey very nearly dynamited it into billions of pieces, but thankfully they placed the dynamite just far enough away from the skeleton that most of it survived the blast,â€ù study coâ€“author Dr. Steve Brusatte of the University of Edinburgh told FoxNews.com. â€œI wasn't there when it was found, but they must have realized right away that they had found something important, and it's great that the fossil was conserved by a museum rather than sold off or auctioned away, where it would have been lost to science forever.â€ùNOT A JOKE: SCIENTISTS STUDY HOW CHICKENS MADE HISTORIC CROSSINGSThe skeleton of the twoâ€“legged Tongtianlong limosus (translation â€œmuddy dragon on the road to heavenâ€ù) was lying on its back with its neck arched and wings outstretched. It also had a crest of bone on its head that researchers believed may have been used to attract mates or intimidate enemies.Related Image Expand / Contract Tongtianlong limosus skeleton (Junchang Lu).Tongtianlong is the sixth species of the oviraptorosaur dinosaur family, a group of feathered dinos known for their sharp beaks and short, toothless heads. Oviraptors were thriving in the 15 million years before the comet that killed the dinosaurs hit Mexico, and Brusatte believes that the most important thing about the new fossil is that it gives us a glimpse of these last surviving dinosaurs.â€œThey were still diversifying during those last few million years of the Cretaceous, so they are a sign that dinosaurs were still doing really well right up towards the end,â€ù the paleontologist said. â€œIt was these dinosaurs that were undergoing the final wave of diversification before everything changed that day the asteroid hit.â€ùBATHROOM TRIP LEADS TO ANCIENT AUSTRALIAN DISCOVERYDespite its wings, the Mud Dragon was flightless so it had to rely on its feet to get away from predators such as the big tyrannosaur Qianzhousaurus, which was the top predator in the area at the time. It also had different feeding habits than a lot of its fellow dinosaurs.â€œThe Mud Dragon didn't have teeth, but rather a beak, so it wasn't a traditional meat eater,â€ù Brusatte explained. â€œIt may have eaten small mammals and lizards, but probably also plants, seeds, nuts, shellfishâ€“all kinds of things. It was a classic omnivore, which is maybe one reason that these dinosaurs were so diverse and successful, because they could eat so many things.â€ùThereâ€™s been a wave of dinosaur finds over the last few years in China, with many new dinosaur discoveries emerging from the country every year. Brusatte said that things donâ€™t look to be slowing down, either.ANCIENT BATTLE LEFT 'SEA MONSTER' WITH TOOTH STUCK IN ITS FACEâ€œMany of these discoveries are not found by professors or academic scientists with PhDs, but by farmers and workmen. This new discovery is a prime example of that. We would never know about it had there not been a building boom in southern China, had these workmen not been on the job that day, or had they not used just the right amount of dynamite to free the skeleton but not destroy it.â€ùThe study can be found in Scientific Reports."foxnews,Industry icons walk the red carpet at The Game Awards 2016,foxnews,Campus police officer shoots teen during confrontation at Nevada high school,"A campus police officer shot a student Wednesday during a confrontation witnessed by dozens of other students at a Nevada high school, according to authorities.Reno police Officer Tim Broadway told reporters that one student was taken to a hospital with unspecified injuries after the shooting at Hug High School. A lockdown was lifted by mid-afternoon and students were released to their parents.More than 40 students witnessed the incident, Broadway said, including many who shot cellphone video that police want to see before the public.""There's multiple videos out there,"" said department spokesman Broadway. ""There's some very disturbing video out there. But there are other events that led up to this incident, so please don't react to those.""Nevada Department of Public Safety Director James Wright told The Associated Press that a 16-year-old was taken to Renown Hospital Medical Center in Reno after he was shot.Neither Wright nor Broadway knew the extent of the teen's injuries, and a hospital spokeswoman said she could not provide information about his condition.Broadway said reports that another student had been stabbed before the shooting weren't true.He wouldn't say whether a knife or any other weapon was involved. He said that the ""disturbance"" was under investigation.The Reno Gazette-Journal reported that it reviewed video showing a student wielding a knife before being wounded.A student, Robert Barragan, told the Gazette-Journal that two male students were fighting outside the school library before a police officer shot the knife-wielding student in the shoulder.The shooting was reported about 11:30 a.m. at the school on the city's north side, a few blocks from U.S. Highway 395.The district issued a statement before 1 p.m. calling the campus ""currently stable and secure with heavy police presence.""Hug High opened in 1968 and is named for Proctor Ralph Hug Jr., a former teacher, athletic coach and Washoe County School superintendent who served as a state senator and a federal judge."foxnews,Snapchat Spectacles: A social media 'sexcessory'?,foxnews,"Dolphins, Cardinals need wins to stay in hunt","A victory won't be nearly enough to solidify a playoff spot for either the Miami Dolphins or the Arizona Cardinals, but a loss on Sunday at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla., will make it that much more difficult for the Dolphins to sneak in through the back door and a loss by the Cardinals would essentially end their season.Miami had won six straight games to climb back into the race only to get blown out this past Sunday by Baltimore 38-6, killing precious momentum that coach Adam Gase thought would propel his team into wild card status.""The first thing we had to do earlier this week was correct a lot of the mistakes that we made in that last game,"" Gase said. ""We had some uncharacteristic mistakes, at least compared to what we were doing the six previous games. It wasn't for a lack of effort.""Guys were flying around trying to make plays. We probably pressed a little too hard, guys trying too hard to make plays. We have to reel it back in, get back to the details of what we were doing -- everybody doing their job -- instead of guys trying to go outside of the box and do too much.""The Cardinals, 2-3-1 in their past six games, haven't been able to fully rediscover themselves following a 13-3 regular-season finish a year ago when they set multiple franchise records on both offense and defense.Coach Bruce Arians, however, thinks his team may have finally turned the corner with last week's 31-23 victory over the Washington Redskins, which saw quarterback Carson Palmer finally connect on a handful of deep passes, the defense finally shut down a team at crunch time, and Arians' own ""no risk it, no biscuit"" philosophy win out.He risked it twice, electing to go for it on fourth down late in the fourth quarter -- and getting a huge 14-yard run by second-year running back David Johnson -- and then deciding to go for the jugular with a long, unexpected pass play -- Palmer hitting J.J. Nelson for a 42-yard scoring strike on second-and-10.In the end, All-Pro cornerback Patrick Peterson sealed the victory with an interception, his 20th since entering the league in 2011.""I still think we can play a heck of a lot better,"" Arians said, adding later, ""We need one more. One more win and I'd consider it a roll. We definitely need to win an away game this week.""Both clubs likely will try to exploit their talented running backs -- Miami with Jay Ajayi and the Cardinals with Johnson -- and then hope Ryan Tannehill and Palmer can hit some shots downfield.Tannehill said the Dolphins and Cardinals are each fortunate to have stellar backs.""It's huge. Jay has been big for us this year,"" Tannehill said. ""I think really getting the running game going was crucial to us starting the ball rolling in the right direction. I think the first big game he had -- the first couple games that we beat Pittsburgh and (the) New York (Jets) -- were huge. That kind of set the momentum, set the tone, for us offensively.""Obviously, he had those huge games, but has just been consistent. He runs hard, physical, tough and gets those tough yards after contact. It has been a big help for us offensively.""Palmer and veteran star wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald, meanwhile, have called Arizona's Johnson a Most Valuable Player candidate. And they might be right.No one has more yards from scrimmage than Johnson, who is two touchdown away from tying John David Crow's 1962 franchise record for most touchdowns in a season (12) and is the only player besides Edgerrin James (2000 and 2005) to record at least 100 or more yards from scrimmage in his first 12 games to start a season.""I think he is, if not the best, one of the best couple players at any position,"" Palmer said of Johnson, who scored twice against Washington. ""There is no doubt he should be in the MVP talks, in my biased opinion. What he does in the passing game, what he does in the run game, what he does to defensive coordinators and opposing defenses late on Monday night, Tuesday, Wednesday and through the week, trying to prepare and figure out where he is going to be and how to stop him is invaluable for us.""Arizona knows that to have a chance against the Dolphins, it must try to contain Ajayi, keep Tannehill from beating them with his legs when he leaves the pocket and try to find a way to neutralize the pass rush of the Miami's feared defensive line, particularly defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh.A big part of that effort will fall on the shoulders of the Cardinals' new starting right tackle, Ulrick John, who was snatched off of Miami's practice squad earlier this season. John replaced D.J. Humphries, who was switched to starting left tackle in place of the injured Jared Veldheer.""We're trying to develop a program to where we can promote from within instead of going to get guys on the street,"" Gase said. ""Them (the Cardinals) grabbing him, that was a tough pill for us to swallow, because they're hard guys to find.""They (young tackles) don't exist around the league. The way that injuries have been going, it's hard to keep your practice squad together. They (the Cardinals) did their research on him and felt like they had a guy they could bring onto their roster that they could develop and put him in this position if they needed him.""The Cardinals aren't sure of the availability of safety Tyrann Mathieu, who is dealing with a sore shoulder. Miami, however, knows it must be careful should it decide to throw the ball anywhere in the direction of All-Pro cornerback Patrick Peterson. Tannehill said he can't treat Peterson like any other cornerback and that he must be mindful at all times with No.21 on the field.""I think you have to. You're aware of him as a player, just like you're aware of an elite pass-rusher or an elite linebacker,"" he said. ""You're aware of guys that can have a big impact on the game. Not necessarily that you're avoiding him throughout the whole game, but you're aware. You want to make sure that it's the right matchup, it's the right shot and the ball is in the right location. If you do leave one behind the receiver or throw one when you shouldn't, he's going to get it. Just an awareness of where he's at in the game is a big part of it."""foxnews,UK Welfare Payments 'Help Fund Islamist Terror Plots',"One of the Brussels bombing suspects was given Â£3,000 of British welfare payments by a group of Islamist fanatics, it has emerged.The so-called â€œMan in the Hatâ€ù (pictured) â€“ whose real name is Mohamed Abrini â€“ has been linked to the terror cell behind this yearâ€™s Brussels suicide bomb and last yearâ€™s Paris gun attacks that claimed a total of 162 lives.Abrini, who is 31, was allegedly captured on CCTV after the Brussels Zaventem airport suicide bombing on March 22 and is awaiting trial in Belgium.Now itâ€™s come to light that months before the Brussels attack he received Â£3,000 of British welfare cash from Zakaria Boufassil, 26, a Belgian citizen living in Birmingham, England.Boufassil was convicted in a London court yesterday of supplying the money to Abrini in July 2015.Abrini was apparently sent from Syria to Britain by a member of his terror cell to collect the funds.Abrini and Boufassil met in a Birmingham park where the handover is believed to have taken place.The cash was obtained from housing and child welfare payments paid in error to another Belgian man â€“ Anouar Haddouchi.Haddouchi had already been fighting for Isis in Syria for a year and had successfully claimed welfare in Britain since 2009 â€“ despite mainly living in Saudi Arabia.In total, nearly Â£11,000 was paid into Haddouchiâ€™s account after he and his wife left for the war zone.Birmingham city council has apologised for the error, which meant that nearly Â£6,000 was paid even after it was informed the pair had vacated their housing.Another man, Mohammed Ali Ahmed, aged 27, was known to British security services and was on police bail when he helped Boufassil hand over the cash to Abrini. He impersonated Haddouchi to gain access to his bank account.Boufassil was found guilty yesterday at Kingston crown court, west London, of engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism.Ahmed pleaded guilty last month to the same offence. They will be sentenced next week.Terror expert Lord Carlile yesterday claimed that hundreds of thousands of pounds of British welfare payments have helped to bankroll Islamist terrorists, triggering calls for a government inquiry.Advertisement"foxnews,Poll: Majority Want Gov't to Prevent 'Fake News' from Spreading,foxnews,Watch How Soldiers Respond When Obama Says No Foreign-Planned Terror Attacks Happened in U.S. Under His Presidency,"BY: JAMES BARRETT | THE DAILY WIREIn a speech at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida on Tuesday, the soon to be former commander-in-chief touted what he deems to be his national security accomplishments.

Instead, Samsung is planning to offer a USB Type-C port in its handset that will accommodate headphones.According to the report, Samsung is removing the port to make additional room for stereo speakers -- a first for the Samsung Galaxy S line -- and allow the company to bundle a bigger battery with its next handset.The move might not be well received.Earlier this year, Apple announced the iPhone 7 with a host of new features , including a more powerful processor and better camera. But one of the biggest gripes about the handset's design was Apple's decision to remove the headphone jack. Owners of the iPhone 7, then, are forced to plug in headphones into the smartphone's Lightning port to listen to audio. Absent an adapter , it's impossible to charge the iPhone and listen to music on it at the same time.According to Sammobile's sources, Samsung also wouldn't allow users to charge their device and listen to music on the handset at the same time. It's unclear whether the company's smartphone will ship with an adapter, like the iPhone 7.The Sammobile report is just the latest in a string of rumors surrounding Samsung's next flagship handset.Over the last several weeks, we've been hearing all sorts of grumblings about Samsung's next move , including reports that the Galaxy S8 could come with a larger screen than its predecessor, deliver a much better camera and offer improved artificial intelligence. It's also believed that the smartphone will be far more powerful than the Galaxy S7 and deliver outstanding battery life.For its part, Samsung hasn't commented on its future plans and likely won't confirm any rumors until it's ready to announce the handset early next year. Debate rages over when Samsung might announce and ultimately release the Galaxy S8, with reports saying it might be unveiled anytime between Mobile World Congress in February and April."foxnews,How to get the best deals in the discount world,foxnews,"Hannity Warns Trump: 'Be Very Careful' With Rahm, Romney & Gore",foxnews,Queen Victoria's bloomers up for auction in the UK,"A pair of linen bloomers that once belonged to Queen Victoria are up for auction in the U.K. later this month.The split drawers have a 42.5-inch drawstring waist and are embroidered with the royal monogram â€œV.R.â€ù for â€œVictoria Regina (Queen Victoria)â€ù and the number â€œ23.â€ù Auction house Henry Aldridge & Son told FoxNews.com that the bloomers were given to the sellerâ€™s grandmother by one of Queen Victoriaâ€™s ladies in waiting.Related Image Expand / Contract The embroidered monogram on Queen Victoria's chemise that is up for auction in the U.K. (Henry Aldridge & Son)Queen Victoria lived from 1819 to 1901, and reigned from 1837 until her death.Henry Aldridge & Son estimates that the pants date to the late 1880â€™s or early 1890â€™s.TITANIC TREASURES SOLD AT UK AUCTIONA linen chemise, or shirt-like undergarment, embroidered with the monogram â€œV.R.â€ù and the number â€œ32,â€ù will also be auctioned by Henry Aldridge & Son in Devizes, U.K on Dec. 17.

Not long ago, a 79-year-old lady in Caracas, Venezuela, received her pension in such way â€” a mountain of bolivar bills she had trouble taking home.â€œI have to put them in the suitcase, because they donâ€™t fit in my wallet,â€ù Clarisa Matson de Garcia told Fox News Latino. â€œAnd then I pray that nobody robs me in the street.â€ùWith the enormously devalued Venezuelan currency ($1 equals roughly 4,400 bolivars in the black market), those 20,000 bolivars barely pay for a T-shirt or a birthday cake.The highest denomination bill in the country is currently 100 bolÃ_vars, the cost of a piece of candy. In a country where approximately 35 percent of the population does not have a bank account, the out-of-control inflation has turned every petty errand and transaction into a major headache.â€œSometimes, when I try to pay with a pile of 10 bolÃ_vars, people donâ€™t accept it,â€ù Matson de Garcia said.Last week, after months of popular clamor, the Central Bank announced that in mid-December it will start rolling out bills of higher denominations. The new highest bill will be 20,000 bolivars â€” some $4.55 in the black market rate, the only market actually available to Venezuelans due to the government's tight currency control.But it will not happen overnight. This week, Central Bank president Nelson Merentes said that on Dec. 15 the bank will start circulating 500 bolivars bills. The other denominations â€“ 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000 and 20,000 â€“ will be issued at a later time.Most economists agree that issuing new bills will alleviate the problem, but not solve it.â€œItâ€™s a relief because the ATMs will have bills of greater denomination, and people wonâ€™t have to withdraw 60 bills of 100 bolÃ_vars to pay for a taxi,â€ù said economist Victor Alvarez. â€œYouâ€™ll be able to do it with six. It will relieve some of the operations in the informal sector.â€ùThe shortage of cash is being increasingly felt in ATMs and banks across the country â€” now Venezuelans need to wait in long lines not only to get food and other essentials, but also to get their own money (limited to 10,000 bolivars a day).Last Sunday, one of the main shopping malls of Caracas, Sambil, had just one ATM in service.â€œI didnâ€™t have cash to pay the bus home,â€ù Roberto Aponte, a young man who had come to the mall to watch a movie, told FNL. â€œIt took me an hour to get the money.â€ùEconomist Asdrubal Oliveros, director of Ecoanalitica, explained that the cash shortage is due to the fact that currency in Venezuela is rendered useless by the country's chronic inflation.â€œThe value of things is way above the bills that we have, and citizens need more bills to do the most elementary things,â€ù Oliveros said.A foreign correspondent working in Caracas, who asked not to be named and does not have a bank account, said he moves around the city with several bags of cash and his pockets full of bills in order to pay for the most basic things.He said he recently went out to dinner at a restaurant with a friend and the check came to 25,000 bolivars. He used 250 hundred-bolivar bills to pay.It makes any kind of shopping cumbersome.â€œIâ€™ve been preparing for Christmas for two months now,â€ù he told FNL.

This may have come as a shock to the industry, who likely believed that theyâ€™d be given a free pass under a Republican presidency and Republican-controlled Congress. It is likely that on Election Day the Big Pharma companies prematurely let out a collective sigh of relief believing that a Republican-led government would never allow for imported medicines or for Medicare to negotiate drug prices, but it appears that the well-deserved panic is starting to set in.On the day Trump was named Time Magazineâ€™s â€œPerson of the Year,â€ù the publication released excerpts from a November interview in which he divulged plans to address out-of-control drug costs.â€œIâ€™m going to bring down drug prices. I donâ€™t like whatâ€™s happened with drug prices,â€ù he said.Those two lines, short enough to fit in a Tweet, sent shockwaves through the industry. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks took a hit, signaling that the relief they had been enjoying since Election Day was short-lived.They could have and should have seen this coming, as Trump has previously advocated for allowing cheaper pharmaceutical drugs manufactured abroad to be sold in the U.S. During his campaign, he also said allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies could save the agency $300 billion per year. While his savings number has been disputed, the cost-cutting measure aligns with what Democrats have peddled before, and he hasnâ€™t backed down yet.Where he will likely run into trouble is with Senate Republicans and the pharmaceutical industry itself, which has significant lobbying power in Congress. But where others before him have bowed to the pressure of medical industry titans, Trump will not. We recently watched Martin Shkreli, a hedge fund manager-turned pharmaceutical CEO raise a life-saving drugâ€™s price from $13.50 to $750 per pill. The public responded with outrage, and Trump called him a â€œspoiled brat.â€ù To her credit, Hillary Clinton criticized him too, but she was also accepting campaign funds from pharmaceutical executives.Shkreli cited the need to â€œturn a profit on the drugâ€ù for the hike, and while he may have come under the most criticism, he is certainly not the first in the industry to put profits before patients. According to prescription-benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co., from 2008 through 2014, average prices for the most widely used brand-name drugs jumped 128 percent. The industry chalks soaring costs up as a trade-off for all the money saved in preventing hospitalizations and illness-related complications. But even once in those hospital settings, something as simple as an Advil will cost significantly more when administered by a medical professional than if you picked it up at a local CVS, and thatâ€™s the industryâ€™s fault.If pretending that practicing preventative medicine is the tradeoff is what makes the industry heads sleep better at night so be it, but for the countless ill patients who cannot afford their medications, no price hike is justifiable. Really, whatâ€™s to blame here is the U.S. government for allowing such atrocities to occur in the first place. If a parent gave his 13-year-old keys to a Ferrari and then the teen crashes it, you donâ€™t blame the teen, you blame the negligent parent.Unlike civilized countries elsewhere in the world, the U.S. government does not regulate prices or partake in negotiations. Drug makers in the U.S. enjoy exclusivity in the marketplace under patents that last for 20 years, preventing healthy competition and the sovereignty of monopoly for a devastating period of time. Generic drug makers are often run out of the marketplace when brand-name medicines hit the shelves as it costs too much to try to keep up.A Wall Street Journal investigation found that compared to Norway, U.S. prices were higher for 93 percent of 40 top branded drugs available in both countries. It was similar in England and Ontario. A large difference between these countries and ours is the power of negotiation. In other countries drug companies are met with price caps and have to prove a drugâ€™s value in comparison to existing ones before getting cost approved.While opponents of government negotiating say it will discourage drug industry research and deny patients access to some medications, I ask them to consider if the alternative that we are living is really that much better. Our patients are already dying without proper medication because of soaring costs, and many causes are short on funding while marketing geniuses and those with good handshakes gobble up airtime and all the spending that comes with it. We need a change, and Iâ€™m hopeful Trump, the great negotiator, will champion it.Dr. Manny Alvarez serves as Fox News Channel's senior managing health editor.

It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top U.S. court in recent years.(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham)"foxnews,Delta flight returns to Dayton airport after engine issue,"Delta Air Lines says a flight bound for Atlanta made a quick return to a southwest Ohio airport because of a possible engine issue.The Atlanta-based airline says Flight 2392 took off from Dayton International Airport on Tuesday morning and returned shortly afterward because of an indication that one of the MD-90's two engines was getting too warm.

Not quite -- in many ways, he appears a successor to LBJ.Following the unprecedented election of Donald J. Trump, many continue to look for precedents. The real estate magnateâ€™s intervention with Carrier reminded columnist Peggy Noonan of JFKâ€™s engagement with the steel industry. Others have likened Trumpâ€™s unlikely campaign to that of another celebrity who upset the established order â€“ Ronald Reagan.The better comparison may be with Lyndon Baines Johnson. LBJ was a crude, rude and not especially popular president who got things done. Unlike President Obama, Johnson was willing to roll up his sleeves and jawbone legislators and business leaders in order to get bills passed and to move the country forward. Thatâ€™s how he was able to sign civil rights legislation in an era when opposition to racial equality came mainly from Republicans but also from vehement members of his own party â€“ the Southern Democrats. He made life impossible for his foes, bullying and wheedling until the bills passed, in the process forever changing the makeup of the Democratic Party.Trump is engaged in something similar. He is already changing the discourse between the corporate world and the Republican Party. In calling out CEOs for ignoring the welfare of their own workers by moving operations overseas, by threatening retaliatory measures against firms that flee the country, and by opposing trade deals like the TPP largely crafted by corporate titans, he is upending the Chamber of Commerce-GOP partnership that has shaped economic policy for decades.To continue reading Liz Peekâ€™s column in the Fiscal Times, click here.Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

John Kelly as his choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security.Kelly told Fox News Trump already has asked him to serve in the DHS position.â€œI have been asked and would consider it an honor,â€ù he said.Kelly would be the third general Trump has picked for his administration, after announcing James Mattis â€“ who along with Kelly is a four-star general -- as his pick for Defense secretary. Trump also announced in November that retired Gen. Michael Flynn would be his national security adviser.Kelly retired from the Marine Corps earlier this year after leading U.S. Southern Command for three years, during which he was involved in the oversight of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay and the southern border.Kelly was picked by Defense Secretary Robert Gates to serve as his senior military adviser and then served in the same position under Leon Panetta before moving to Southern Command.Kelly complained at his last Pentagon press conference in January that after 40 years as a Marine he had the authority to watch drug dealers heading to the border by sea, but he could not disrupt them. He is believed to have a good relationship with current DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson, with whom he served as Pentagon general counsel.He served three tours in Iraq, and holds the somber distinction of being the most senior military officer to lose a child in combat in Iraq or Afghanistan. His son, Marine 2nd Lt. Robert Kelly was killed in November, 2010, in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.Known as an outspoken but loyal commander, Kelly will be first to lead the department who is not a lawyer and the fifth overall. The department was formed after the 9/11 terror attacks in order to help foil future attacks on the American homeland.Sources say Trump has settled on Kelly for the role, and is expected to name him in the next few days. Kellyâ€™s selection will require confirmation by the Senate.Immigration enforcement is a familiar issue for Kelly, and a big part of the DHS portfolio. Southern Command, which is based in South Florida, regularly works with DHS on missions to identify and dismantle immigrant smuggling networks. And it has partnered with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in an operation targeting human smuggling into the U.S. and helped with the rescue of children arriving alone at U.S. borders.While Trump has tapped military officials for key appointments, doing so can also bring complications. Gen. Mattis will need to secure a waiver from Congress in order to be considered due to a requirement that military officials be out of service for seven years before being secretary of Defense.Trump, meanwhile, said Wednesday that he has taken, and acted on, advice from President Obama on who he should appoint to various positions in his administration.â€œI have asked him what he would think of this one and that one,â€ù Trump said on NBC's ""Today"" show. â€œI would say that, yes, I take his recommendations very seriously and there are some people that I will be appointing, and in one case have appointed, where he thought very highly of that person, yes.â€ùWhile he did not go into specifics, he said that he likes Obama ""as a person"" despite the brutal criticism he leveled at the president on the campaign trail.""I will say this, I've now gotten to know President Obama. I really like him. ... I can't speak for him, but we have a really good chemistry together. We talk,â€ù Trump said.A coziness between current and former presidents is not unusual. President George H.W. Bush wrote President Bill Clinton a warm note when Clinton took office, while President Obama has repeatedly spoken of how accommodating President George W. Bush's team was to Obama in the lead-up to him taking office in 2009.Fox Newsâ€™ John Roberts and Jennifer Griffin and The Associated Press contributed to this report."foxnews,Pearl Harbor ceremonies take place across the nation,"It was a somber day Wednesday at the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum, where hundreds gathered to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the attacks on Pearl Harbor.The â€œday that will go down in infamyâ€ù hits especially close to home for former President George H.W.

The former president managed to safely bail from his burning aircraft and was later plucked from a raft, in the middle of the sea, by the USS Finback, a lifeguard submarine.More than seven decades later, vintage WWII-era planes, just like the one Bush used to fly, soared over the crowd of spectators as part of the Pearl Harbor commemoration at his library in College Station, Texas.A moment of silence was also held at 11:55 Central time, or 7:55am in Hawaii, the exact moment the attack on Pearl Harbor began.The afternoon program included a panel, moderated by Brit Hume of Fox News.More than 20 World War II veterans were among the distinguished guests in attendance at the Bush Presidential Library â€“ including former Senator Bob Dole and Aaron Cook, the sole Pearl Harbor survivor in Wednesday's crowd.â€œI don't really know how to describe it,â€ù Cook said.Cook was just 19 at the time, and was working as a Chief Petty Officer in the US Navy, stationed on Ford Island. He remembers seeing the planes swoop in and unleash bombs.â€œIn retrospect, I'm glad I'm here. And I'm glad the country has survived,â€ù he explained.Now in his 90s, Cook said itâ€™s important to pay homage so that future generations can understand the significance of that day and a valuable piece of history simply isnâ€™t forgotten when he and his fellow troops are gone.â€œPeople just don't seem to be responsive. Kids go to sleep when you're talking to classes and they don't even know what Pearl Harbor is. They just don't realize how important it is,â€ù he added.To help educate and further inform the public about the significance of Pearl Harbor, a special exhibit has been set up at the President Bush Presidential Library and Museum, which will run through the end of this year.â€œWe began working on this about six months ago,â€ù said David Jones, CEO of the George Bush Presidential Library Foundation.â€œTwenty-five years ago President Bush spoke at the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, as the sitting president, and we have a copy of the speech in our auditorium here on a continuous loop,â€ù Jones said.There also is a digitally re-mastered version of President Franklin Delano Rooseveltâ€™s famed speech for spectators to view, with the words of comfort he offered to stunned-Americans after the attacks.Casey Stegall joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in 2007 and currently serves as a correspondent based in the Dallas bureau.

In the incident, captured on video, the TSA agent then goes back up and repeated the process along Albertâ€™s right leg. But when the agent moved her hands to her chest, Albert, co-host of a media company called â€œThe Moms,â€ù had had enough. â€œYou canâ€™t touch me there,â€ù she told the agent. â€œYou canâ€™t touch me there â€_ You canâ€™t touch me there.â€ùShe later filed a complaint with the TSA, saying the went too far and calling the treatment humiliating.While the treatment of Denise may not have been great, the TSA is responsible for keeping our planes safe! Were they right to inspect her â€” especially after finding metal in her chest?"foxnews,Questions Trump and Hillary should (must) be asked at the first debate,"Next weekâ€™s presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton could determine the outcome of the election. As polls show Trump leading in some swing states and closing the gap in others, it appears the only burden he must overcome is the one Ronald Reagan shared, looking presidential enough that voters trust him with so much power.The way these debates have usually gone in the past is that the Republican candidate is asked about abortion, gay rights and other social issues and the Democratic candidate is asked about subjects that appeal to a wider range of voters.Lester Holt, the â€œNBC Nightly Newsâ€ù anchor, will moderate the first debate. Here are some questions he should ask:For Clinton: You once supported traditional marriage, but now favor same-sex marriage. Polygamists now want to be next in line to receive legal and cultural approval. Do you oppose polygamy, and if so on what basis? If elected president, how would we know you wouldnâ€™t change your mind on this issue?Follow-up: What is your standard for defining right from wrong?For Trump: You were pro-choice, you said, until you heard about a baby that was going to be aborted, but wasnâ€™t. You called the child a â€œtotal superstar.â€ù Do you have a utilitarian view of human life â€” that a baby is only valuable if it grows up to be a superstar â€” or is every life valuable?For Clinton: You said you would have a â€œbunch of litmus testsâ€ù for Supreme Court nominees, including requiring potential nominees to have a commitment to preserving a womanâ€™s right to an abortion. Would you overlook qualified candidates because they oppose abortion?For both candidates: North Korea is developing nuclear weapons that will fit on top of missiles capable of reaching the U.S. Would you authorize a missile defense system able to shoot down North Korean missiles, despite Chinaâ€™s opposition to such a system?Also for Clinton: You appear to have an interventionist foreign policy record. What is your standard for sending American forces into battle, especially in the Middle East where nothing ever seems to get resolved?Follow-up: In one of your emails you praise Sidney Blumenthalâ€™s son, Max, for his virulent anti-Semitic and anti-Israel comments, favoring the dismantling of the State of Israel. Since Israelâ€™s enemies have also vowed to destroy the only democracy in the Middle East and one of the United Statesâ€™ few allies in the region, as president, would you support the Jewish state or demand that it give up more land to Palestinians when the land it has already relinquished has brought it no closer to peace?For Trump: Many voters are worried about your praise of Russian president Vladimir Putin, who routinely behaves like the KGB agent he once was. Putin has invaded and occupied territories, censored the news and been accused of murdering his opposition. Why do you admire his leadership? Should you become president, what do you think your public praise of Putin will accomplish that will be in Americaâ€™s interests?Follow-up: Under what circumstances would you use military force against Russia or our enemies in the Middle East?For both candidates: North Korea is developing nuclear weapons that will fit on top of missiles capable of reaching the U.S. Would you authorize a missile defense system able to shoot down North Korean missiles, despite Chinaâ€™s opposition to such a system?For Clinton: The federal government took in record amounts of tax money in 2015 â€” $3.18 trillion â€” but the debt is approaching $20 trillion, and you want to spend more. Why wonâ€™t you propose cutting programs that arenâ€™t working?For Trump: What agencies and programs would you eliminate or reform?Public interest for the debates will be at Super Bowl level. These and similar questions would produce the information undecided voters need to cast their votes wisely.The future of this country hangs in the balance.Cal Thomas is America's most widely syndicated op-ed columnist.

Milan Chatterjee was a law student and president of the Graduate Student Association when he was accused of violating a policy at UCLA called â€œviewpoint neutrality.â€ù Chatterjee says his offense was remaining neutral. Thatâ€™s right, in the upside down world of alleged campus tolerance and so called social justice Chatterjee says he was accused of refusing to take sides in a politically charged matter, and a campus investigation found him guilty of violating â€œviewpoint neutrality.â€ùIn this episode of TALKENOMICS Chatterjee says the UCLA administration sacrificed him to the mob by denying him legal representation during what he calls kangaroo court proceedings. But, a confidential report from the investigators which university staff posted on the internet concluded Chatterjee had violated the â€œviewpoint neutralityâ€ù policy because there was no requirement for him to remain neutral.Chatterjee says students opposed to his neutral position slandered his reputation online, and it got so bad he had to withdraw from school and move from Los Angeles to New York to pursue his education. In a scathing letter sent to UCLA Chancellor Gene Block, Chatterjee wrote, â€œI have been relentlessly attacked, bullied and harassedâ€_â€ù His story is a warning for any student who dares anger the thought police."foxnews,De Blasio Finally Accepts Blame for City's Homeless Crisis,"By Yoav Gonen | NYPostNearly three years into his administration, Mayor Bill de Blasio finally accepted responsibility for the cityâ€™s homeless crisis.â€œI own it,â€ù he said on WNYCâ€™s Brian Lehrer program on Wednesday. â€œI have to own everything â€” the things that work, the things that didnâ€™t.â€ùA year ago, the administration was singing a different tune by continuing to point fingers at predecessors for the ever-increasing homeless population."foxnews,Amy Schumer tells off critics for fat-shaming her over possible Barbie role,"Amy Schumer went after critics who slammed her potential casting as Barbie in an upcoming live-action film based on the Mattel doll.Variety reported last week Schumer was in talks to play Barbie and the plot of the movie would involve the character getting kicked out of Barbieland for not being perfect enough and going on an adventure in the real world.The comedian posted a picture of herself in a swimsuit on Instagram Tuesday. She says those who attempted to fat shame her have failed because she knows she's not fat and has ""zero shame"" in her game. Schumer says the backlash has made it evident that she's a ""great choice"" to play ""an important and evolving icon.""""Is it fat shaming if you know you're not fat and have zero shame in your game? I don't think so,"" she wrote on Instagram. ""I am strong and proud of how I live my life and say what I mean and fight for what I believe in and I have a blast doing it with the people I love. Where's the shame?""She also said, ""Thanks to everyone for the kind words and support and again my deepest sympathy goes out to the trolls who are in more pain than we will ever understand. I want to thank them for making it so evident that I am a great choice. It's that kind of response that let's you know something's wrong with our culture and we all need to work together to change it.

Renan Calheiros back on his job one day after the key ally of President Michel Temer refused to abide by the suspension order issued late Monday by Justice Marco Aurelio Mello.However, the full court decision stopped Calheiros from being No. 2 in line for the presidency while he stands trial on corruption charges in one of 12 suits against him.Despite the favorable decision for Calheiros, he probably won't face an easy time with Brazil's top court in the near future. Chief Justice Carmen Lucia said Calheiros turned his back to the whole judiciary by refusing to obey the suspension ruling.Calheiros, whose term as president of Brazil's upper house ends in February, and the board of the Senate published a letter Tuesday refusing to recognize Mello's order.All members of the court referred to the lawmakers' defiance in their votes.""Brazil is living an institutional anomaly at this moment,"" Justice Luiz Fux said, though he voted in favor of Calheiros.Mello called the senators' defiance ""unconceivable"" and ""grotesque.""""These are strange times in this suffering Republic,"" he said.Sen. Jorge Viana of the Worker's Party would take over if Calheiros was permanently removed as Senate president. Viana is an adversary of Temer and an ally of former President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached earlier this year and replaced by Temer, her vice president.Losing Calheiros as Senate president would be a severe blow to Temer, who is hoping to push through Congress a series of belt-tightening measures this month.Before the court voted Wednesday, several Brazilian media outlets reported that Temer, Viana and others had approached justices to negotiate a middle of the road solution to avert a constitutional crisis.The case in which Calheiros is to stand trial dates from 2007, when he was also the head of the Senate. At the time he was forced to resign after accusations he received kickbacks from the lobbyist of the Mendes Junior construction company. Calheiros has denied any wrongdoing.The Supreme Federal Tribunal also has several open investigations against Calheiros in the sprawling corruption probe at state-run oil giant Petrobras. A former senator who is a business executive has charged that Calheiros received almost $10 million in bribes over 10 years. A former Petrobras director accused Calheiros of threatening to withhold support unless he was paid off. The same person said Calheiros was paid $1.7 million through a Petrobras lobbyist in a case related to drill ship contracts.Calheiros denies wrongdoing in those cases, too."foxnews,National poll: Trump's favorability numbers rising,foxnews,"Federal judge halts recount, sealing Trump's Michigan win","A federal judge who ordered Michigan to begin its recount effectively ended it on Wednesday, tying his decision to a state court ruling that found Green Party candidate Jill Stein had no legal standing to request another look at ballots.The ruling seals Republican Donald Trump's narrow victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton for Michigan's16 electoral votes.U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith agreed with Republicans who argued that the three-day recountmust end a day after the state appeals court dealt a blow to the effort. The court said Stein, who finished fourth in Michigan on Nov. 8, didn't have a chance of winning even after a recount and therefore isn't an ""aggrieved"" candidate.""Because there is no basis for this court to ignore the Michigan court's ruling and make an independent judgment regarding what the Michigan Legislature intended by the term 'aggrieved,' plaintiffs have not shown an entitlement to a recount,"" Goldsmith said.It was the judge's midnight ruling Monday that started the recount in Michigan. But Goldsmith's order dealt with timing â€” not whether a recount was appropriate. More than 20 of 83 counties already were counting ballots again. They reported minor changes in vote totals, although many precincts couldn't be examined for a second time for a variety of reasons.Earlier Wednesday, the Michigan elections board voted, 3-1, to end the recount if Goldsmith extinguished his earlier order.State Republican Party Chairman Ronna Romney McDaniel and Attorney General Bill Schuette said it's a victory for voters and taxpayers. Stein now is left with asking the Michigan Supreme Court to intervene, which is a long shot.""Jill Stein, who received only 1.07% of the vote in Michigan, is not legally entitled to hijack the will of voters and drag them into an arduous and expensive publicity stunt,"" McDaniel said.Stein got about 1 percent of the vote in three states where she's pushed for recounts â€” Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump narrowly won all three.She insists she's more concerned about the accuracy of the election, but Goldsmith said Stein's legal team presented only ""speculative claims"" about vulnerable machines, ""not actual injury.""The judge said a recount to test the integrity of the voting system ""has never been endorsed by any court.""A court hearing will be held Friday on a possible recount in Pennsylvania. Wisconsin's recount, which started last week, has increased Trump's margin of victory over Clinton thus far.Clinton needed all three states to flip in order to take enough electoral votes to win the election. Trump has 306 electoral votes to Clinton's 232; 270 are needed to win. Michigan has 16 electoral votes, Pennsylvania has 20 and Wisconsin has 10.

That time span may seem long, but it's actually quite surprising that a snake would eat three enormous meals in a relatively short window, Boback told Live Science. [Photos: This Invasive Python Ate Three Wild Deer]""If a python is capable of eating three deer in three months,"" what else are they eating that we don't know about, he asked. ""We don't even know how many of them are out there [in the Everglades].""Burmese pythons are native to Southeast Asia, but for reasons still shrouded in mystery, they became established in the Everglades during the 1990s. The snakes can grow to be up to 18 feet long in the Everglades (and up to 26 feet long in Southeast Asia). They use their strong muscles to wrap around prey, obstructing their victims' blood flow until circulation stops.Deer trioIt's unclear how the python attacked the deer, but the snake may have hid in the water, waiting for the deer to stop for a drink. That would have left the deer within striking distance of the snake, Boback said.The 15.6-foot-long female snake was almost done digesting its three massive meals when officials caught and euthanized it on June 3, 2013. A necropsy, or animal autopsy, revealed an empty stomach but intestines packed with poop.The fecal matter was immense: more than 14 lbs., or 13 percent of the snake's body mass , Boback said. Study co-researchers Teresa Hsu and Suzanne Peurach, scientists at the Smithsonian Institution, sieved through the excrement and found mats of fur and several undigested hooves, bones and teeth, indicating that the python had eaten white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) â€” and not just one, Boback said.It's no surprise that the fur, hooves and teeth were undigested, as pythons can't break down keratin or enamel, Boback said. However, they can digest bone, which would explain why the researchers found only fragments of bone in the dung, he said.The size and shape of the hooves â€” as well as the presence of a deciduous, or baby, tooth â€” indicated that the adult doe was at least 1 year old and about 99 lbs., one fawn was about 1 month old and 37 lbs. and the other fawn was about 2 weeks old and 29 lbs., the researchers wrote in the study. [In Images: Hungry Python Eats Porcupine Whole]Python invasionPythons are ravenous eaters, and they've been wreaking havoc on the Everglades ecosystem, Boback said. The hungry snakes hunt the region's native animals, including birds, mammals and at least one reptile â€” the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), the researchers wrote in the study.Although other Everglades studies have shown correlations between the presence of pythons and a drop in mammals â€” such as raccoons, opossums, bobcats and rabbits â€” the new report shows concrete evidence that pythons can eat more than one deer within a short period of time, Boback said.""It just begs the question, 'How often are they eating these things?'"" he said.The study was published in the November issue of the journal BioInvasions Records.Original article on Live Science ."foxnews,Scientists identify fossilized dinosaur brain tissue for first time ever,"A brown pebble discovered on an English beach more a decade ago is actually the world's first known example of a fossilized dinosaur brain, scientists have confirmed.The remarkable find is thought to have come from a large plant-eater such as the Iguanodon, which walked the earth about 133 million years ago.It is believed the creature must have died near water with its head buried in sediment in a swamp or boggy ground, allowing its brain to be ""pickled"" and preserved.Dr Alex Liu, from Cambridge University's Department of Earth Sciences, said: ""The chances of preserving brain tissue are incredibly small, so the discovery of this specimen is astonishing.""Analysis of the fossil has revealed similarities with the brains of birds and crocodiles - both close relatives of dinosaurs - living today.Click for more from SkyNews."foxnews,The First 100 Days: Trump's immigration agenda,foxnews,Endangered sea turtles are actually thriving at Belize reef,"Endangered hawksbill sea turtles are doing swimmingly well at a reef in Belize, the Wildlife Conservation Society has announced.The sea turtles are described as â€œcritically endangeredâ€ù by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, so the fact that theyâ€™re prospering at Gloverâ€™s Reef Atoll in Belize is good news for conservationists. According to a new study, researchers estimate that there are now over 1,000 juvenile hawksbill turtles in the area.â€œThe findings of our research show that juvenile hawksbill turtles are thriving at Gloverâ€™s Reefâ€“ extremely good news for this endangered species,â€ù Virginia Burns Perez, the Wildlife Conservation Societyâ€™s technical coordinator in Belize, said in a statement. â€œStrongholds for the species such as this one should become a model for other foraging and nesting areas that are important for the hawksbill turtle.â€ùWANT TO MONITOR BEARS? TRY CHECKING THEIR SALIVAThe study, published in the journal Endangered Species Research, reports that the hawksbill turtle population numbers have suffered in general due to â€œharvest for their shells, meat, and eggs.â€ù The researchers carried out their research between 2009 and 2013 in an area thatâ€™s part of a huge barrier reef system thatâ€™s actually a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of their research involved snorkeling and catching, tagging, and releasing the turtles.The Wildlife Conservation Society says that the sea turtleâ€™s rebound is an indication of the success of protection efforts in this large reef system.â€œThe discovery that Gloverâ€™s Reef Atoll is an important habitat for young sea turtles is an important find, one that will enable regulatory agencies to fine-tune already effective management policies to safeguard a highly threatened species and its biodiverse habitat,â€ù Jason Patlis, the WCSâ€™s director for marine conservation, said in the statement."foxnews,Great or gross: Wacky food creations,"This decadent creation is part dessert, part cocktail-- and 100 percent delicious.

The famed 10th-century Danish king Harald Bluetooth is thought to have ordered the construction of the fortress.So far, archaeologists have found at least 14 iron tools inside a single deposit of earth excavated from a gatehouse building of the fortress. The researchers said only traces remain of the wooden chest that once held the tools. [See Photos of the Viking Tools Found at the Danish Fortress]Iron was valuable in Viking-age Denmark , and the researchers think the tools once belonged to a craftsman who occupied a workroom in the gatehouse until it collapsed in the late 10th century.The archaeologists are still studying the heavily rusted objects, but they've already identified several sophisticated hand tools and other metal items, including a set of ""spoon drills"" that were used to make holes in timber; what looks like a pair of tweezers or small pliers; a ""clink nail"" used to fasten wooden planks together; four carefully crafted chain links attached to an iron ring; and a drawplate to make metal wires that may have been used in jewelry.Archaeologist Nanna Holm, a curator at the Danish Castle Center in Vordingborg who is leading the excavations of the ringed-shaped fort at Borgring, said this is the first time an entire set of tools has been discovered in a Viking workplace.""This is not an ordinary find,"" Holm told Live Science. ""Not many tools are found in Scandinavia, but the others found before this have all been left for the gods, by being put down in a swamp.""The newfound tools are special because they were found where the craftsman would have been working, she said. ""That's why it's so exciting for us to see what's inside, because we can see what one man has used at this specific site,"" Holm added.Viking ironThe cache of iron tools was first located by amateur archaeologists using a metal detector near the eastern gate of the buried fortress at Borgring.That discovery inspired Holm's archaeological team in August to excavate the eastern gatehouse, where they removed the deposit of earth containing all the tools in one piece â€” a delicate process that took two days.The next step was to transport the lump of earth, rust and iron to a local hospital, where it was scanned with computed tomography (CT) equipment usually used by doctors to examine the internal organs of their patients. [Photos: 10th-Century Viking Tomb Unearthed in Denmark]The CT scans revealed the precise arrangement of at least 14 iron tools, which have since been excavated from the toolbox deposit for individual X-ray studies and preservation before they are put on display in an exhibition next year, Holm said.All of the tools are heavily corroded, but much of the original iron remains, and even more tools may be hidden in the rust, according to the researchers. ""There are a minimum of 14 tools, but I think there are 16 now, from the new X-rays that we've already done,"" Holm said.The contents of the toolbox provide a rare glimpse of working life in the late Viking age , she said.""They can be used for different crafts,"" Holm said. ""We have some spoon drills for making holes in wood, which could be used for building ships or for building houses.""The iron drawplate has a series of small holes of different sizes that were used to make wires from softer metals, the researchers said. ""You pulled the metal through each of the holes to make it smaller and smaller, and thinner and thinner,"" she explained.Bluetooth technologyThe toolbox is an important early find for the archaeologists, who will conduct further excavations at Borgring each summer for the next three years, Holm said.The remains of houses and human graves have been found at other Viking ring forts, but the toolbox is the first direct evidence of human habitation at Borgring itself, she added.""So far, we haven't found any houses, but we now have proof that there were people here â€” so hopefully, next year, we will find their houses,"" Holm said. [Fierce Fighters: 7 Secrets of Viking Culture]Archaeologists think the ringed-shaped fort at Borgring and four others like it were built by the Danish king Harald Bluetooth around A.D. 980, as military outposts to enforce his rule as he introduced Christianity into Denmark and parts of Sweden and Norway.The origin of the king's curious surname is uncertain, but his success in uniting the unruly Viking clans into a single kingdom inspired the name of today's Bluetooth wireless technology , according to the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), which oversees development of the technology.Borgring has appeared on maps since the 1600s, but Holm said the site was only recently recognized as one of Bluetooth's network of Viking ring forts.""This is the first ring fort in 60 years that we'll be studying with all the new archeological methods, and today we can do so much more with science,"" she said. ""It's pretty different work compared to what else we've done in Denmark, so this is something special. Hopefully, we will get a little bit closer to finding out what actually happened here and what the forts have been used for.""Original article on Live Science.Copyright 2016 LiveScience, a TechMediaNetwork company.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MARIA BARTIROMO, HOST: Good morning. Allies united against ISIS. Hi, everyone. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Welcome to ""Sunday Morning Futures.""Jordan pounding ISIS targets this morning. The UAE back in the battle supplying more planes.Now how should Americans add our own muscle to the fight against ISIS? We're covering this story throughout the program this morning with congressional and military guests.The GOP presents its plan to erase ObamaCare.Is it better? Is it likely to pass? We'll discuss the details of that and a lot more with Senator John Hoeven coming up.And a full court press by the West to end the Russian-Ukraine conflict. How far did they get? We'll take a look and talk to a business man with an insider's view of just how corrupt post-Communist Russia really is. He barely escaped with his life. Others, not so lucky. He'll tell us his first-hand story as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""(MUSIC PLAYING)BARTIROMO: And Jordan continues to pound ISIS strongholds this morning, not believing the terror group's claim that a Jordanian airstrike has killed U.S. hostage Kayla Mueller.Meanwhile the president plans to formally ask Congress to authorize the use of military force against ISIS in the coming days.What should the U.S. response be now? Congressman Bob Goodlatte is with me, he's the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and he joins us now.Good to see you, Congressman. Thanks for joining us.REP. BOB GOODLATTE, R-VA.: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: So what should the U.S.' response look like, when we hear from the president to authorize the use of military forces, what do you think that force should look like?GOODLATTE: I believe for a long time that the current authorization for use of military force in Iraq, now more than a dozen years old, is out of date, needs to be replaced. We should take a careful look at what the president presents to us, recognizing it's a good thing that Jordan and some of the Gulf states and others in the Middle East are recognizing they're on the front lines.The threat is to them. And they should step up. We should support them and we should give the president appropriate authority to do that support.Now one of the big questions, of course, will be what about boots on the ground?Again, we've got to be careful not to tie the president's hands. But we do not want to have major U.S. military ground forces placed back in an area where we think others should be stepping up and taking the lead. But targeted strikes and rescue missions and a whole host of other activities, spotters on the ground and so on, we need to give the president some flexibility in this area. But we need to look carefully at an appropriate authorization of use of military force.BARTIROMO: The U.S. has been carrying out airstrikes against ISIS in Syria and Iraq since August.Has it worked?GOODLATTE: I think it has definitely helped. There is no question that we've turned them back in a few places. We've seen some towns recovered by Kurdish forces and other forces in the area. But obviously more needs to be done.I think that some of the terrorist acts that they have taken place, burning Jordanian air force officer in a cage, may be a reflection of their desperation more than it is simply their barbarity. But either way, I think this is a long-term battle against Islamic radical terrorists. And we need to make sure we're doing our part.It's not just happening in the Middle East. FBI Director Comey said in Mississippi just a couple of days ago that they have active investigations of suspected ISIS collaborators in 49 states. So this is something we can't simply allow to say it's going to happen in someplace else and we don't need to be involved in it. We do need to be involved.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Yes, Congressman. I wanted to hear more about that and I also want to ask you about the idea of cyber security and Internet terrorism. So stay with us, Congressman Bob Goodlatte.First, let's dig deeper into the scope of Jordan's fight against ISIS. Fox News senior correspondent Eric Shawn joins us now with that angle.Good morning to you, Eric.ERIC SHAWN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria.And good morning, everyone. It has a king who is also an attack helicopter pilot who did not hesitate to strike back. King Abdullah is leading not from behind, but from the front.A monarch in a flight suit, a potent symbol of Jordan's defiance against ISIS, 53-year-old King Abdullah, who served in the Royal Jordanian Army and flew Cobra antitank helicopters in the air force, is now taking the fight directly against the ISIS killers.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MOHAMMAD AL MOMANI, STATE MINISTER FOR MEDIA AFFAIRS, JORDAN: We will do whatever it takes in order to fight this organization and defeat this organization. We think this is the best of our country. Of course we strongly believe that other countries in the region as well as the international community must shoulder part of the responsibility.SHAWN (voice-over): Jordan vows that a, quote, ""relentless war against ISIS"" and has carried out four days of continuing airstrikes in revenge for that barbaric burning to death of its pilot, despite being dwarfed by larger militaries. The country ranks number 67th, according to global firepower and military strength with a defense budget of $1.5 billion. It can field just over 110,000 active military personnel. The air force has 246 military aircraft, including 74 fighters or interceptors and 42 fixed-wing attack aircraft.But like the U.S., Jordan continues to rule out sending so-called boots on the ground. Even though Iraq and Syria's Arab and Persian Gulf neighbors can potentially field armies of more than 1 million troops against the Islamic State. But for now have no plans to do that.AL MOMANI: I think that nobody is talking about troops on the ground. The idea about boots on the ground is that we will help the Iraqi military.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHAWN: But Jordan says since that unforgivable video was released, it has launched 56 strikes against ISIS and has so far flown 946 sorties out of a total of 5,500 coalition airstrikes or just under 20 percent. Scrawled on a Jordanian bomb that was hanging under a jet fighter just before a mission against ISIS was one simple message. It said, ""For you, the enemies of Islam."" -- Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, Eric, thanks very much, Eric Shawn with the latest there.More now with Congressman Bob Goodlatte.And, Congressman, you have been a leader in terms of Internet and technology issues on your committee. Let me get your take on your expectations for cyber terrorism and whether or not this is an area that you think ISIS will next pursue.GOODLATTE: Well, it is certainly something that various elements of terrorist organizations have pursued and the United States needs to step up its game. Greater cooperation between government agencies, greater cooperation between private companies and the government in making sure that cyber attacks of various kinds are repulsed. We need to make sure our intelligence organizations have the ability to gather the information they need but not at the expense of the civil liberties of law abiding American citizens.We passed a good bill through Congress last year to take up again this year offered by Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner that set, I think, the right guidelines, barred the government from collection of metadata but still gave them the opportunity to do what they need to do to gather the information to investigate terrorist plots that can take place in the United States and elsewhere in the world.BARTIROMO: Congressman, lay out the next two days for us when the president asks Congress for the authority for more military force.How does this play out this upcoming week?GOODLATTE: We should take that and look at it very carefully. I don't think we need to rush into giving a very quick response. Remember the president has had a mixed record here. He did not seek authorization for use of military force to go into Libya. Many complications have ensued from that.He then sought the authorization to go into Syria against the current Syrian government. That got a very negative response from the Congress. I think there's more open-mindedness right now about finding the right balance here in terms of giving him the authority that he needs without us stepping out in front of these Middle Eastern nations like Jordan that need to take the lead in protecting their region and in fighting ISIS. But we should be strong supporters of what they're doing.BARTIROMO: And Jordan is one of a handful of Middle Eastern countries that have joined the fight against ISIS.Are you expecting that number to increase?GOODLATTE: I certainly hope it will because they clearly are the ones who are on the front lines. This kind of radical terrorism is not what I think they want the world to see about the Middle East. There have been Muslim clerics around the world speaking out against the horrific acts taken by ISIS and we need to get their help in pushing back on this because this is a long-term problem with extremism trying to take hold, not just in the Middle East. We saw it in France just recently and we've seen it in the United States before and we'll see it again if we're not proactive in combating it.BARTIROMO: Congressman, we'll be watching. Thanks very much for joining us today.GOODLATTE: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon.Republicans unveil a Plan B meanwhile for ObamaCare.What are the details?How is their replacement different from the Affordable Care Act?We'll talk with Senator John Hoeven about that next.I hope you'll follow me on Twitter @MariaBartiromo is my handle, @SundayFutures is the program. Let us know what you'd like to hear from Senator Hoeven. Send me a tweet. Stay with us as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""(MUSIC PLAYING)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A group of congressional Republicans, Senators Richard Burr and Orrin Hatch and Congressman Upton have unveiled their place -- their plan to replace ObamaCare. It is similar to an outline proposed last year by Burr, Hatch and former Senator Tom Coburn.It includes targeted tax credits for those living up to 300 percent above the poverty line, allowing insurance companies to sell plans across state lines, repealing the individual mandate. But, like ObamaCare, kids can stay on their parents' plans until they're 26 years old. And pre- existing conditions are covered, that is, unless you let your coverage lapse for a couple of months, under the GOP plan. Insurers could take that into account.Senator John Hoeven is joining us. He is on the Appropriations Committee and the Energy Committee.Senator, good to have you on the program.SEN. JOHN HOEVEN, R-N.D.: Thanks, Maria. Good to be with you.BARTIROMO: What is the viability of this new replacement to ObamaCare, do you think?HOEVEN: I think it's a good plan. It's about empowering people rather than expanding government. And if the Supreme Court strikes down the subsidy that states are getting under the federal exchange, we're going to have to have another plan. And I hope there's some support both in the Congress and on the part of the administration to go to this kind of approach.BARTIROMO: What kind of an impact have you seen so far from anticipation of ObamaCare or actual implementation of ObamaCare?HOEVEN: I'm -- your question on the...BARTIROMO: What kind of an impact have you seen already in terms of businesses, in terms of the economy, people's lives?HOEVEN: Yeah, I mean higher costs, not only for businesses but for individuals in terms of their health care insurance. And that's why the kind of plan that we're talking about now can create more competition and help bring health care costs down and gives people more choice.BARTIROMO: What would you like to see in terms of other priorities for the budget?The president released his budget. What is your response in terms of what he's likely to do in terms of raising taxes and -- and creating more revenue for things like education and infrastructure projects?HOEVEN: Well, his budget is a real problem. And I don't believe it's going to go anywhere in Congress. If you look at it, it's $2.1 trillion in higher taxes. It's $2.4 trillion in more spending. It's $8.5 trillion over 10 years in more debt for this country. And that makes it harder for entrepreneurs and small businesses to create jobs and grow the economy. And so that's not what Americans want. That's why Congress is not going to go that direction. What we're going to try to do is do things like reduce the regulatory burden, engage in tax reform that stimulates our economy and encourages job creation for our businesses across this great country.BARTIROMO: And how does this ObamaCare plan, or replacement plan, do that?HOEVEN: Well, the -- it helps by giving more choice, more competition, reducing the regulatory burden -- again, not only helping our businesses in terms of reducing costs, giving them more options, but for individuals as well. That's the kind of thing that makes our economy go. When you make it easier to do business, then entrepreneurs, small businesses create more jobs. When you make it more expensive, you have higher tax burden, more regulation, that's what hurts job creation.BARTIROMO: Senator, let me move on to the Keystone Pipeline, which I know you have been pushing passage for. But I want to start with North Dakota. Because North Dakota, of course, is a very big oil-producing state, producing more than a million barrels of oil a day, second largest oil producing state. What has been the impact on the state of this sharp sell- off in the price of oil that we've seen in the last year?HOEVEN: Maria, we're starting to see some slowdown. Obviously, the price of oil now just a little over $50 a barrel. You know, actually, we're locked in a global competition to see who's going to supply energy globally. So OPEC, Russia, now the United States. You know, we're battling for market share. So we have to continue to help build our industry in this country. So far we've seen some slowdown in our state, not too much. How much more we'll see depends on what happens with the price.BARTIROMO: Right. I mean, is it fair to say that the -- the rise in supply, whether it's the shale revolution in America or OPEC and non-OPEC countries, that's the reason oil prices have come down so much?HOEVEN: Maria, without question, one of the things I often see is OPEC didn't decide to give us a Christmas present this year. The reason gas prices are lower, dropping over the last year from something like $3.27 a gallon down to about $2.17 a gallon is because we're producing so much more energy. And that's how it works. If we continue to grow our energy base in this country, we not only become energy secure but we reduce the price at the pump for our consumers. The benefit they've received so far would be, if it were a tax cut, would be equal to more than $100 billion in the consumer's pocket.BARTIROMO: Yeah, I mean, you have been talking about the importance of the Keystone XL Pipeline, and yet the president continues to say he is going to veto this. So these threats continue. What are you going to do if the president vetoes this in the next couple of weeks?HOEVEN: You know, Maria, that's the great irony. We're producing more energy; it's strengthening our country; it's helping our allies; it's benefiting consumers and businesses, you know, throughout our economy.And now the president, on the one hand, takes credit for it, and then, on the other hand, he is trying to block it. We need the infrastructure and we have to build the business climate so we can produce more energy, not less, here in North America. And then we don't have to depend on OPEC for oil, and we're stronger as a country and we have a stronger economy.BARTIROMO: Yeah, I think it's also worth mentioning the fact that the oil is going to get here by hook or crook. It's only going to come on rail cars as opposed to coming through a pipeline. And we're already seeing a real capacity congestion on the tracks, right, because oil is being transported on rail car?HOEVEN: You make a great point. That oil is going to move either by rail or by pipeline. If it moves by rail, that's 1,400 rail cars a day which not only creates more congestion, more risk of accident, that kind of thing, but it also blocks our movement of other goods. The safest way to do it, the most cost-effective way to do it, with the best environmental stewardship, is with the proper infrastructure, the right mix of pipelines, rail and roads.BARTIROMO: Senator, good to have you on the program. We'll be watching the developments. Thanks so much.HOEVEN: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Senator John Hoeven joining us.Germany resisting calls to send weapons to Ukraine in its fight against Russian-backed rebels. So what will it take to make President Putin change his ways?An author who knows post-Soviet Russia inside and out is next, as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Germany is balking at appeals by Ukraine for weapons to fight Russian-backed rebel separatists. Chancellor Angela Merkel expressing little optimism following the latest peace talks between Kiev and Moscow. My next guest knows firsthand just how corrupt post-Soviet Russia really is, having done business with some of its most powerful players. He is the author of ""Red Notice"", a true story of high-finance murder and one man's fight for justice. He is Bill Browder.And it is good to have you on the program, Bill.BILL BROWDER, AUTHOR: Good to see you.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. First off, let's talk about the issues of the day. Ukraine needs help. Larry Summers was on this program last week basically saying it is more important for us to be doing helpful things for Ukraine like sending them armament than fighting Russia. Because, if you fight Russia, you're pushing Putin in a corner, and he is going to fight back even more aggressively.BROWDER: Well, the first thing you have to know is that Putin started this war. Putin is doing this war for internal Russian domestic reasons. He's trying to distract his own population from his corruption. And so this war is not about any historic ties with Ukraine or about NATO. This is Putin aggressively attacking Russia (sic) to try to get people stirred up into a nationalist frenzy.And so Putin will not back down in Ukraine. Anything that -- and there's basically nothing we can do to talk him into backing down, which means that the only choice we have in the West is to put pressure on him.BARTIROMO: So do you think the U.S. should be aiding Ukraine with armaments?BROWDER: Absolutely. I mean, so either we're going to have to go and fight Russia ourselves or let the Ukrainians fight Russia. But right now, they're getting slaughtered because Russia has an enormous amount of money to invest in military equipment; Ukraine has effectively run out of their military equipment and they need as much help as they can get.And that's the one thing we can do without directly going to war with Russia ourselves.BARTIROMO: All right. I want to talk about your story in particular. Because you really -- you have an inside, first-hand account. At one point in your career you were running money; you were an investment manager, and you were the single largest investor in Russia.BROWDER: Yeah.BARTIROMO: Tell us what happened?BROWDER: So I was -- I was investing in Russia. I discovered that the companies I was investing in were run corruptly by corrupt oligarchs. We started to fight the corruption. That angered the -- that angered Putin and his cronies. I was expelled from the country. My offices were raided. They tried to seize my companies. And they ended up stealing $230 million of taxes that we paid.I hired a young lawyer named Sergei Magnitsky to investigate. He discovered the crime, testified against the officials. He was then arrested, tortured...BARTIROMO: In -- in Russia?BROWDER: In Russia. He was arrested in Russia by the people he testified against. He was then tortured for 358 days in Russian custody and killed. And then, after they killed him, they then exonerated everybody involved and put him on trial, after he died, in the first ever trial against a dead man in the history of Russia. They put me on trial as his co-defendant. And we said to ourselves ""Russia is bent from top to bottom,"" after that, and looked for justice outside of Russia.BARTIROMO: How do you know that -- and you think Putin ordered this killing of your lawyer?BROWDER: I don't know if Putin ordered this killing, but I can say with 100 percent certainty that Putin has been involved in the cover-up of his murder. And we have evidence of that. So here you have the president of a country where his -- it wasn't my money that was stolen. It was his own tax money that was stolen from his own Treasury; $230 million stolen from his country. A young man tries to be patriotic. That young man is killed for exposing it. And then he's involved in the cover-up of that young man's murder.BARTIROMO: So what does this -- your experience tell you about dealing with Putin and about dealing in, you know, post-Soviet Russia?BROWDER: Basically, what this tells you is that Putin is a criminal, first and foremost. He's running a criminal enterprise to maximize profits. He's a criminal, but he's different than the Mafia of Italy or the Mafia of -- of New York in that he has all the powers of a sovereign state. He can arrest people; he can go to the United Nations. He has a -- he has his finger on a nuclear button if he wants to use that. So you have a Mafia boss with his finger on a nuclear button.BARTIROMO: And yet you have this popularity ranking that keeps coming out, that the people love him. Is that a complete lie? Are they just afraid?BROWDER: Well, let me ask you this. If you were living in Russia, a totalitarian state, and where bad things happen to people who oppose the president, and some stranger calls you up from the Levada polling agency and says, ""Do you support the president or not,"" what's your answer going to be?BARTIROMO: Yeah, I -- I understand.So where do you think this goes? In terms of Putin and Russia taking over Crimea, moving further into Ukraine, what are your expectations of how this plays out?BROWDER: Well, so I think the whole thing is based on the fact that Putin is a kleptocrat and he needed something to distract the people. And so he needed to start a war to -- to get everyone whipped up into a big nationalist frenzy.They're in a nationalist frenzy that -- and in response to that, there's an economic crisis because of sanctions. And so he's got to whip people into a further nationalist frenzy. And so I don't think -- so he's not going to back down from Ukraine.And my fear, and I think this is very likely, is that he's going to start exploring his military ambitions in other countries. And the thing that's most worrying is the Baltics. Because the Baltics are part of NATO. And NATO is -- is an organization in which the United States and Europe are all treaty members, which means that, if he goes into the Baltics, we have an -- either an obligation to fight Russia to protect the Baltics or NATO falls apart.BARTIROMO: Quite extraordinary.

Lieutenant General Dan Bolger is on deck, as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: And back to our top story, as we await any word on U.S. hostage Kayla Mueller, what should the U.S. military response against ISIS be at this point?Retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Daniel Bolger is the author of ""Why We Lost: A General's Inside Account of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars.""Sir, good to have you back on the program.Welcome.LT. GEN. DANIEL BOLGER (RET.), U.S. ARMY: Hello, Maria.BARTIROMO: What should the U.S. response be at this point?The president will be asking for increased military authority against ISIS in the coming days.BOLGER: Well, you -- you named one of the big things, and that's to get the domestic support of the American people as expressed through their elected representatives in Congress.Real, real important because this is a long-term struggle.Yes, you've seen some -- some accelerated air strikes in the wake of the death of the Jordanian pilot, Lieutenant al-Kasasbeh, a heinous execution done on film by ISIS. They don't do that just to be awful. They do that because it excites people and causes them to want to join ISIS, young -- young men, primarily, in that region.It's a long-term struggle, Maria. And it means we've got to be in it for the long haul. And that's why that Congressional authorization is really important.BARTIROMO: And, of course, Jordan has really stepped up, accelerating its response against ISIS.How would you characterize Jordan's response?BOLGER: Well, Maria, Jordan is a -- is a strong ally in that region. They're a front line state. ISIS is not something that happens around the world. It's right next door. They've got challenges right on their border.They've had al Qaeda and ISIS operatives in their own country.King Abdullah is himself military trained. He went to Sandhurst, the British military academy, the equivalent of our West Point. He's a -- he's a qualified Special Forces officer, he's a qualified pilot.So when he gives the order for his -- for his military to retaliate against ISIS, he knows exactly what he's telling people to do because he's done it himself.And I'll tell you the other thing that were not seeing. All these air strike videos are impressive, but what we're not seeing behind the scenes that's even more important is this strong effort to tigis -- target ISIS leadership.ISIS leaders like Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was on our target list back when we were in Iraq in 2003 to '11, guys like him should to go sleep every night worrying that the door is going to get busted in and they're going to get shoot right between the eyes.BARTIROMO: And -- and we do have the proper sort of intelligence to target that leadership, you think?BOLGER: We're working on it. I'll tell you, this is where the Jordanians and the other states in the region come in. And they're very important.Jordan has excellent intelligence services. Ours are good. We also have our other friends in that region to include the Iraqis and then the Kurdish militias that are part of Iraq.Altogether, it's going to paint a picture that's going allow us to put that pressure and -- and threat to that ISIS leadership.And it's going after their leaders that's going to -- going to do the most damage.But again, a long, long effort. We're talking years before we see final results.BARTIROMO: But the president is going to be asking for more military support.Do you think that support should include boots on the ground?BOLGER: Well, Maria, it already does. But the boots on the ground should not be Americans. We learned in our -- our campaign in Iraq in '03 to '11, as great as our young men and women are, it's very difficult for 100,000 Americans to lead a counterinsurgency and -- and build a successful state in the face of local rebels.The right answer is for us to back the local people as they try and sort out their own problems. That's what the president is asking for. And to me, it shows that we have learned some lessons from what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan.BARTIROMO: You know, in the last two weeks or so, there has been a feeling that ISIS has become desperate, that, in fact, we have been effective in terms of, as you say, taking down some of the leadership.But as a result, they have begun to falter.Do you agree with that notion?BOLGER: I do not. One of the things you've got to watch in a country like Iraq, it's natural for the enemies there to take a little bit of a break when the weather gets rainy, as it does in their winter there. It's not as extreme as winter in the Northeast United States, but -- but it's definitely a change of season.You'll see an ISIS spring offensive. ISIS has strong presence in the Sunni Arab areas of -- of Syria and Iraq and -- and they're -- it's going to take a lot of work to get them out of there.These -- these despicable actions they're taking against people like that Jordanian pilot, they're being done to allow for recruiting. I wish it was desperation because they were under pressure, but I don't think we're there yet.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there.General, we'll be watching.Thanks very much for joining us today.BOLGER: Thanks.BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon.Lieutenant General Daniel Bolger.Now, let's get a look at what's coming up on ""MediaBuzz"" top of the hour with Howard Kurtz -- Howie, good morning to you.HOWARD KURTZ, HOST, ""MEDIABUZZ"": Good morning, Maria.We've got exclusive new details of the Brian Williams debacle at NBC, including that he decided voluntarily to take a leave of absence yesterday. He wasn't pushed to do so by NBC executives.And there is no internal investigation at NBC. It's a fact-gathering inquiry to help the network play defense.And as we look at whether he can survive this credibility crisis at NBC, it must be particularly fascinating for you, as somebody who spent two decades at that organization.BOLGER: Well, it's interesting. So -- so but basically what I hear you saying, Howie, is that NBC is not doing anything.The question is, will NBC's credibility continue to come down if, in fact, Brian Williams' credibility is on the line?KURTZ: I think what's clear here is that Brian Williams has to do more to answer the questions not just about what happened in Iraq, where he has now acknowledged peddling a false story, but other questions being raised about other parts of his reporting.If he can't do that, then NBC, I think, is going to have to make a very difficult decision.BARTIROMO: Howie, we'll be there in 20 minutes.Thanks so much.We'll see you at the top of the hour.KURTZ: Thanks.BARTIROMO: Howard Kurtz.The presidential candidates show their hands.

We have four or five very serious governors and four or five senators who will probably make the race.I think at this point, Bush obviously has picked up the pieces of the Romney departure. He's sort of going to be the establishment candidate. He's raising a lot of money, putting a good, strong team together.Governor Walker is getting a lot of attention the last couple of weeks.

Heâ€™ll command an expansive nuclear arsenal, an unparalleled military and a Twitter account with 16.9 million followers.That last item gives Trump the unique ability to go around the major media. It makes him a one-man super power â€“ able to push policy agendas, compliment allies and critique the press.The American media are terrified of Trump. They are freaked out by his ability to talk directly to the American public.Even more, they are enraged over his willingness to attack them â€“ the people who think they are â€œtruth tellers.â€ùWhat many in the left and the news media donâ€™t seem to understand is that Trump is doing his job.In slightly less than a month since the election, Trump has already passed the benchmark of the first 100 Tweets of his new administration. More than one-fourth of those more than 100 tweets has criticized the biased media.Trump has blasted the â€œfailingâ€ù New York Times 10 times, and knocked â€œone-sided, biasedâ€ù ""Saturday Night Live"" and the â€œhighly overratedâ€ù play ""Hamilton.""According to Socialbakers.com Trump's followers have skyrocketed since the election, from roughly 13 million followers to nearly 17 million.Monday, he aimed his tweets in a full broadside at the traditional news media:â€œIf the press would cover me accurately & honorably, I would have far less reason to ""tweet."" Sadly, I don't know if that will ever happen!â€ù he wrote.Trump had told ""60 Minutes"" that he would cut back on Twitter as president just days after the election. â€œIâ€™m going to be very restrained, if I use it at all, Iâ€™m going to be very restrained,â€ù he explained to correspondent Lesley Stahl.That appearance was cited by CBS News on Monday night. But they seem to have forgotten what else he said during the earlier interview. â€œI have a method of fighting back,â€ù he added.Heâ€™s right. And he needs it to even the odds against the press that is still campaigning against him.Trumpâ€™s tweets have been widely criticized in the media, including on ""Saturday Night Live."" Liberal actor Alec Baldwin mocked Trump in the skit saying his â€œbrain is bad,â€ù explained Townhall. ""â€˜I just retweeted the best tweet. I mean, wow, what a great, smart tweet,â€™ Baldwin says after sharing a 16-year-old high schoolerâ€™s tweet -- which actually happened last month.â€ù ""The Viewâ€™s"" Whoopi Goldberg urged simply: â€œâ€œStay off Twitter and do your job now.â€ùSo-called journalists are just as bad. CNNâ€™s Chris Cuomo admitted to Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway the press is â€œdistracted from a little bit of analysis of the cabinet by the tweeting once again.â€ù Cuomo listed a few of the topics Trump had targeted on Twitter and asked her, â€œIs this really how he's going to spend his time as president?â€ùThe Times ended up confused, wondering, â€œIf Trump Tweets It, Is It News? A Quandary for the News Media.â€ù The news organization that has 32 million followers on Twitter, isnâ€™t sure if Twitter is a legitimate form of communication?! The paper inadvertently made Trumpâ€™s case for using Twitter, amidst its internal angst: â€œMr. Trumpâ€™s Twitter account â€” a bully pulpit, propaganda weapon and attention magnet all rolled into one â€” has quickly emerged as a fresh journalistic challenge and a source of lively debate.â€ùThe Times quoted liberal Nation editor and publisher Katrina vanden Heuvel urging news outlets to limit covering what Trump said. â€œMedia would be wise to stop hyper-coverage of Trumpâ€™s tweets â€” they distract, distort and debase,â€ù she whined.Not everyone agrees that Twitter is bad, even on the left. White House Press Sec. Josh Earnest told reporters defended Trumpâ€™s use of Twitter â€œPresident Obama has found Twitter to be a useful mechanism for communicating with the American public and providing some insight to all of you about what heâ€™s thinking about,â€ù he told the press corps.What many in the left and the news media donâ€™t seem to understand is that Trump is doing his job.Former vice president Dick Cheney gets it. He told a defense forum recently that Twitter is â€œsort of a way around the press.â€ù Cheney added: â€œHeâ€™s at the point where we donâ€™t need you guys anymore.â€ùAnd thatâ€™s what really scares journalists. That he doesnâ€™t need them. Why deal with an activist, left-wing news media that is continuing its campaign against him?Nancy Reagan became famous for the slogan, â€œJust say no.â€ù In Trump terms, that should become: â€œJust tweet no.â€ùDan Gainor is the Media Research Center's Vice President for Business and Culture.

That's not the greatest news for Apple at this time, considering the iPhone battery performance issues it's already dealing with. But before you start to jump to conclusions, it's important to make it crystal clear that no, iPhones do not have a serious battery problem like the Galaxy Note 7.All battery-powered devices have a theoretical risk of explosion. It happens very infrequently with most devices, which is why it was immediately apparent that the Galaxy Note 7 has a more serious issue -- dozens of users reported unusual overheating and explosions immediately after the phone launched. Samsung ultimately had to admit defeat and cancel the handset two months after its release.According to The Wall Street Journal, Shanghai's Consumer Council is the group that issued the third battery-related complaint against Apple in China. The previous two concern spontaneous iPhone shutdowns even when there's still plenty of juice left in the device.Apple responded and stated that it has analyzed the affected iPhone 6 units and determined that the fires were caused by ""external physical damage."" The company also instructed customers to visit an Apple store or contact company support if they experience any issues with their iPhones.""We appreciate that customers are more concerned than ever about the performance and safety of batteries in their mobile devices,"" an Apple statement reads.Even so, Apple's battery troubles are far from over in the region. Earlier this week, Apple acknowledged that its iPhone 6s battery drain problem is more widespread than initially believed, saying that a software update might fix it. The company offers a free iPhone 6s battery replacement program, but it's not available to all iPhone 6s users in the region.Meanwhile, local consumer groups say that older iPhone models and iPhone 6s units not covered by the program are also affected by the same spontaneous shutdowns."foxnews,NOAA will livestream dives to Japanese mini subs near Pearl Harbor,"On Wednesday, the 75th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, NOAA will livestream dives to two Japanese mini submarines, the first of which was sunk by the USS Ward prior to the attack.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will use an underwater robot operated from its ship Okeanos Explorer to send back images from the wreck sites, which are near Pearl Harbor.""Until now, only a handful of explorers and scientists have seen these relics of the war in the deep sea,"" said James Delgado, director of maritime heritage at the NOAA Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, in a press release. ""But thanks to technology, anyone and everyone can now dive with us in the first live exploration of the 'midget' submarines that represent the beginning of the war in the Pacific.""INCREDIBLE IMAGES REVEAL US NAVY SEAPLANE LOST IN PEARL HARBOR ATTACKNOAA explains that, on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, U.S. naval vessels and aircraft on patrol outside Pearl Harbor saw a partially submerged submarine attempting to enter the harbor, but alerts were not immediately sent out. Some 90 minutes before Pearl Harbor was bombed by Japanese aircraft the USS Ward fired on the mini sub and sank it, marking the first U.S. shots fired in World War II.The second submarine disappeared on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, but was discovered in shallow waters in 1951 and raised by the U.S. Navy. The sub was then taken out to sea and dumped in deeper water, before its rediscovery by the University of Hawaiâ€™iâ€™s Undersea Research Laboratory in 1992. The last time the wreck was visited by the universityâ€™s submersibles was in 2013.NOAA told FoxNews.com that the first livestreamed dive, which will visit the submarine sank by the USS Ward, will start at 11:30 a.m. ET and is expected to end at 1:30 p.m. ET Wednesday. The dive to the second submarine, which is lying in three pieces, will start at 4:30 p.m. ET and end at 7:00 p.m. ET Wednesday.INCREDIBLE IMAGES OFFER FIRST GLIMPSE OF SUNKEN WWII-ERA AIRCRAFT CARRIERThe livestream will be available here.Last year NOAA and the University of Hawaiâ€™i released incredible images of a U.S. Navy seaplane sunk during the opening minutes of the attack on Pearl Harbor.Earlier this year scientists also released stunning images of the light aircraft carrier USS Independence, which was intentionally sunk off California in 1951.Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers"foxnews,Tucker Battles Activist Who Compared Trump's 'Person of Year' Nod to Hitler's,foxnews,FoxNews.com - Breaking News,foxnews,Rome bans gladiator actors from ancient tourist hot spots,"â€œGladiatorâ€ù fans who have been saving up for a trip to see Rome's ancient sites may be a little disappointed by the city's recent decision to ban playactors dressed as ancient, sword-wielding warriors from many popular attraction.The ban, issued by mayor Virginia Raggi who says she received several complaints, targets anyone portraying a historical subject (centurions are specifically mentioned) in pictures or videos in exchange for cash, The Local reported.CARDINALS FIGHT PLAN TO OPEN MCDONALD'S IN VATICAN CITYAnd itâ€™s not just the gladiators that have been forced to take their cos-play elsewhere.

But as the fallout from his recent conversation with the president of Taiwan indicates, an increasingly assertive China poses the most vexing and far-reaching challenges for American prosperity and security.China has accomplished hyper growth supplying Western consumers with inexpensive goods and attracting Western investment to obtain necessary technology, but it has hardly played by the established rules and norms of global trade. It has subsidized exports, manipulated its currency and engaged in other abusive practices.Trump has promised to slap a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports to get a better deal through existing international agreements, echoing a strategy advocated by Mitt Romney.The $320 billion annual deficit on trade in goods and services with China depresses demand for American-made products, curtails funding for U.S.-based R&D, kills millions of jobs and is a principal cause of the blight in communities like Reading, Pa. , and Hickory, N.C.President-elect Trump must prepare for a diplomatic and perhaps military showdown in the Pacific and to confront Beijing on the massive trade imbalance that finances Chinese mercantilism and adventurism.Just as menacing are the trillions of dollars in cumulative trade surpluses China has amassed that are financing a dramatic pivot in its industrial, military and foreign policies, threatening security in the Pacific and Americaâ€™s standing with allies around the globe.As wages rise in Chinese coastal manufacturing centers, jobs move farther west in China and elsewhere in Southeast Asia, causing major social disruptions. For example, Dongguan, near Hong Kong, has endured job losses on a scale similar to large Midwestern cities in the U.S.To buffer job losses and limit political unrest, Beijing is pursuing a two-pronged strategy.It is imposing tougher restrictions on foreign investment, which further depresses the value of the yuan, ladles on more subsidies for basic manufacturing, tightens administration restrictions on imports and consolidates state-owned enterprises to enhance their monopoly power.Simultaneously, it is encouraging more technology-intensive activities that strike at the heart of American and European competitiveness through lavish subsidies for startups, acquisitions of U.S. and European businesses and toughened regulation of American and other foreign technology companies operating in China. In the process, many products and components used by its basic assembly and fabrication operations, once sourced in the United States and western Europe, are now made in China.Most of those tactics either violate World Trade Organization rules or are decidedly asymmetrical. For example, the United States, Germany and other European nations generally permit the Chinese to purchase companies outright, whereas Western investors generally must offer Chinese joint-venture partners a substantial stake when establishing subsidiaries in the Middle Kingdom.While Chinese technology still lags behind Western capabilities in many complex and mundane areas, such as rice cookers, it has managed to leap ahead in some fields â€” for example, satellite technology for espionage-proof and encrypted communications.In addition, the cash earned from its huge trade surpluses is financing a massive buildup in naval and air power, militarization of the South China Sea and about 20 port facilities the Chinese navy can access in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Europe. It also has established an Asian International Development Bank, and the Chinese government and private investors are plowing billions of dollars into the economies in Asia and Africa through infrastructure projects and direct investment.President Obama has been hesitant to take the advice of U.S. defense leaders in challenging Chinaâ€™s artificial islands and militarization of the vital South China Sea, and the combination of Chinese muscle and billions in new investment has encouraged the Philippines and Malaysia, longtime U.S. allies, to tilt toward Beijing.The latter substantially undermines the U.S. strategy of resolving sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea and securing the sea lanes from Chinese control by relying on the recent U.N. tribunal ruling denying Beijingâ€™s claims and through U.S. military and diplomatic cooperation with regional allies.The South China Sea has huge seabed mineral deposits and is a vital passage for some $5 trillion of international shipping annually. Open access has been secured by the U.S. Navy in cooperation with regional allies since World War II, and the stability of that framework is vital â€” not merely to global commerce, but also to U.S. credibility with strategic allies in the Middle East and Europe.President-elect Trump must prepare for a diplomatic and perhaps military showdown in the Pacific and to confront Beijing on the massive trade imbalance that finances Chinese mercantilism and adventurism.American prosperity and security depend on it.Peter Morici served as Chief Economist at the U.S. International Trade Commission from 1993 to 1995.

She doesnâ€™t want to stay married.â€ùThe insider added that Kim wonâ€™t make any decisions until Kanye is fully recovered, stating: â€œSheâ€™s being a supportive wife. She cares about Kanye and feels relieved heâ€™s getting the help he needs but sheâ€™s felt trapped for a while.â€ùIt has been widely speculated that the couple may be experiencing marital issues after it was claimed that the rapper is living apart from his wife and their two kids â€“ North, three, and Saint, 12 months â€“ as he receives outpatient care following his 10 day stay in UCLA Medical Center.A source told People magazine: â€œKim is being very protective and doesnâ€™t want Kanye around the kids right now.â€œKanyeâ€™s behavior took a huge toll on their marriage. But Kim feels relieved he is getting the help he needs. She thinks this is what it will take to save him â€” and help their marriage.â€ùWhile another source added: â€œHe is receiving outpatient care else with a medical team. Kim still seems concerned but is supportive.â€œThey donâ€™t know for how long Kanye will need outpatient care â€_ There are frustrations and problems, like any relationship, but they love each other deeply.â€ùHowever, it has also been reported that Kanye was allowed to attend the low key 1st birthday party for the coupleâ€™s son, Saint.TMZ.com reported he left the hospital â€œunder the care of Kim and his personal physician Dr Michael Frarzam.â€ùThe Famous hitmaker was admitted more than a week ago after suffering a breakdown which was believed to have been triggered by the nine-year anniversary of the death of his mum Donda West.Meanwhile, it was previously claimed that Kanye is desperate to get back to work but has been ordered to rest up.A source shared: ""People in Kanye's inner circle are hoping the hospital stay has made him realize that he needs to take a step back from work and focus on his personal health and mindset.""Kanye loves working, but he loves Kim and his family more. He had way too much on his plate and it came to a point where he couldn't handle it all, so he just broke. He needs to find a good balance with the two in his life and he'll work hard at finding that.""Whilst another insider added: ""Kanye keeps wanting to work. At the hospital, he requested that recording equipment be brought to the hospital so he can record in his bed. And he has kept asking to see sketches of his fashion lines. He continues to want to work and Kim has to keep telling him to rest.""Kim has been married twice before after she eloped with music producer Damon Thomas in 2000 at the age of 19.However, the marriage was over two years later and Thomas filed for divorce. Kim went on to claim the pair separated due to emotional and physical abuse in the relationship.Kim then married basketball star Kris Humphries in August 2011 but the marriage famously last for only 72 days.This article originally appeared in The Sun."foxnews,Stolen mummy hand makes its way home,"The blackened, cloth-wrapped hand arrived in a parcel at Los Angeles International Airport in January 2013. It was listed as a sci-fi movie prop, valued at $66. But as officials with U.S. Customs and Border Protection learned, the hand was from a real Egyptian mummy, nearly 3,000 years old.The hand was apparently voluntarily forfeited by the importer, and U.S. authorities have repatriated it and four other illegally smuggled artifacts to Egypt as part of an ongoing investigation known as ""Operation Mummy's Curse.""""It's sort of amazing the things people will try and ship across international borders,"" archaeologist Fredrik Hiebert, a National Geographic fellow, said in a video statement. [See Photos of the Mummy Hand and Other Artifacts Returned to Egypt]In addition to the eighth-century-B.C. mummy hand, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, also returned intricately painted ancient sarcophagi in a ceremony at the Egyptian embassy in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 1.""While we recognize that cultural property, art and antiquities are assigned a dollar value in the marketplace, the cultural and symbolic worth of these Egyptian treasures far surpasses any monetary value to the people of Egypt,"" ICE Director Sarah SaldaÃ±a said during her remarks.ICE launched ""Operation Mummy's Curse"" in 2009 to bust a network of antiquities smugglers bringing illicit artifacts from other countries into the United States. SaldaÃ±a said her agency has made four arrests and two convictions in this investigation.The operation has also recovered about 7,000 artifacts, not just from Egypt, but also from Greece, India and Iraq. ICE has already returned many of those cultural objects in past repatriation ceremonies. In March 2015, for example, ICE returned artifacts to Iraqi officials , including an ancient Sumerian ax that was being sold on Craigslist in 2012 as well as a gold-plated soap dish from Saddam Hussein's palace that turned up in Connecticut. In April 2015, ICE handed over dozens of other artifacts to Egypt, including a nesting sarcophagus the agency recovered from a garage in Brooklyn, New York.Though international treaties and Egyptian laws protect Egyptian artifacts, a black market for antiquities thrives. Using satellite data, researchers have documented an uptick in illegal excavations across archaeological sites in Egypt over the last decade.Smugglers using forged papers can bring looted material into the U.S. under the guise of a robust legal antiquities market. Census Bureau documents show that about $26 million worth of artifacts were exported from Egypt to the United States just during the first five months of 2016. But that could change. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry signed an agreement with Egypt on Nov. 29 that imposes tougher import restrictions on Egyptian archaeological material that dates from 5200 B.C. to A.D. 1517.Original article on Live Science."foxnews,This adorable jumping robot is totally off the wall,"Thereâ€™s a new robot on the block, and itâ€™s a cute, frog-like creation thatâ€™s an amazing jumper.Named SALTO and developed in California, the machine stands just about 10 inches tall, but can jump straight up from a crouch to over three feet high. Not only that, the robotic critterâ€” made with an eye towards someday helping with search and rescue operationsâ€” can execute a parkour-like move and jump off the ground, then off a wall.Duncan Haldane, first author on a study about the new robot and a PhD candidate at University of California, Berkeley, said his team was inspired to make SALTO after talking with first responders at an urban rescue training site.NEW RECORD! ROBOT SOLVES RUBIK'S CUBE IN LESS THAN A SECONDâ€œOur goal was to have a search and rescue robot small enough to not disturb the rubble further, [and] move quickly across the many kinds of rubble produced by collapsed buildings,â€ù he said during a teleconference on Monday. â€œTo do that, it has to be able to jump.â€ùFurther inspiration for the robot came from a stellar natural jumper, an animal called a galago, or bush baby, that can jump as high as about five and a half feet high in the lab, and do it quickly.â€œWe donâ€™t quite reach the galagoâ€™s performance, but SALTO has 56 percent more vertical jumping agility than any other untethered robot,â€ù Haldane said.HARVARD HAS BUILT A CIGARETTE-SMOKING ROBOT, AND IT'S HERE TO HELPHaldane highlighted that because the robot is such a good jumper, it can use its environment in a dynamic way, like leap off the ground, then bounce off a wallâ€” a skill that calls to mind the famous parkour chase scene in the James Bond film â€œCasino Royale.â€ùâ€œThe closest model for what weâ€™re trying to do is human parkour,â€ù Haldane said, in a video about the robot. â€œYou have these people that like excel at running over buildings, bouncing off of all these crazy obstacles, using stuff that would otherwise be an obstacle, like a wall, as a feature to help yourself move.â€ùThe study about SALTO appears in the first issue of a new journal, Science Robotics.Follow Rob Verger on Twitter: @robverger"foxnews,"Cunard Line, P&O Cruises cancel all 2017 calls to Turkey","Turkey's tourism industry has been dealt some heavy blows in the wake of deadly terrorist attacks and an attempted coup this summer.According to Cruise Critic, Carnival Corporation's Cunard Line and P&O Cruises have both confirmed the cancellation of all calls to Turkey next year.""After careful consideration, we have taken the decision to remove Turkey from all itineraries in 2017 for both Cunard and P&O Cruises, based upon various sources including advice given by the U.K.â€™s Foreign and Commonwealth Office,"" the cruise lines said in a statement.Planned stops in Turkey will be replaced with calls in Greece and Albania.The news may disappoint travelers looking forward to enjoying some of Turkey's historic sites, Cunard and P&O aren't the first cruise lines to pull out of the troubled destination.Some cruise lines â€” including Disney Cruise Line, Crystal Cruises and MSC Cruises, among others â€” canceled calls in Turkey this year following a series of high-profile incidents.The U.S. State Department continues to warn Americans of ""increased threats from terrorist groups throughout Turkey.""""U.S. citizens should avoid travel to southeast Turkey and carefully consider the risks of travel to and throughout the country,"" the department said in a travel warning issued Oct. 29."foxnews,Trial of accused Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof begins,"Dylann Roof sat quietly as the lead prosecutor in his death penalty trial described Wednesday how he allegedly opened fire on a dozen members of a Charleston church who had welcomed him to a bible study.â€œHe seemed to the 12 to be harmless,â€ù prosecutor Jay Richardson said during his opening statement. â€œBut little did they know what a cold and hateful heart he had.â€ùMISTRIAL DECLARED IN NORTH CHARLESTON POLICE SHOOTING CASERoofâ€™s lawyer David Bruck, a renowned opponent of the death penalty, told jurors he expects a guilty verdict. But he urged jurors to consider Roofâ€™s background and motivations when they decide whether he should be sentenced to prison for the rest of his life or whether he should be executed.The large group of observers in the packed courtroom included family members of the nine victims who died in the massacre at the historically black Emanuel AME Church the evening of June 17, 2015.TWO GEORGIA POLICE OFFICERS SHOT NEAR COLLEGERoof, an avowed white supremacist, had initially said he wanted to act as his own attorney. He has since agreed to allow lawyers to represent him in the initial guilt phase of the trial, but not in the sentencing phase. Under this arrangement, Roof himself would have the option to cross-examine witnesses during this later phase â€” including victimsâ€™ relatives.â€œNormally youâ€™d have a defense attorney asking the questions and the defendant sitting at the defense table,â€ù said Ashleigh Merchant, an Atlanta-based criminal defense attorney. â€œBut not in this situation. Youâ€™d actually have him speaking directly to the victim. And that very well may be the answer as to why he wants to represent himself.â€ùBut Merchant said there are other reasons clients refuse legal representation during sentencing â€” including a desire to prevent their lawyers from bringing up information about their past. Such information may play on jurorsâ€™ sympathies, but can be embarrassing for a defendant.â€œIâ€™ve had that in my own practice, where my client suffered great abuse during his childhood or suffers from mental illness,â€ù Merchant said. â€œAnd the reasons that he did this crime, he just does not want to come out in public.â€ùThe beginning of the Roof trial comes just two days after another racially-charged case ended in a mistrial in a courthouse across the street. A jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict on whether Michael Slager, a white North Charleston Police officer, committed a crime when he fatally shot Walter Scott, an African-American motorist who fled on foot during a routine traffic stop last year.Roofâ€™s defense team requested a delay in jury selection and opening statements, arguing that publicity surrounding the other trial might influence jurors in their case. But U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel denied the motion and the trial began on schedule.Jonathan Serrie joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in April 1999 and currently serves as a correspondent based in the Atlanta bureau."foxnews,Is Mariah Careys new diet too extreme?,foxnews,Teacher barred for 12 years after dragging student by hair,"Fired, criminally charged and with her state teaching license on the line, Linda Winters-Johnson admitted Wednesday that she'd been wrong to drag a special education student by the hair across the gym floor at Greenville High School.""I am an imperfect human who has made a grave mistake,"" she told Mississippi's Teacher Licensure CommissionThe commission, though, didn't buy her remorse. After brief deliberations, a three-commissioner panel voted to bar Winters-Johnson from the classroom for 12 years.Raina Lee, a lawyer who handles educator misconduct proceedings for the state, said it was the longest such sanction she'd seen. Mississippi has no legal provisions for permanently revoking a teacher's license, although department officials say they plan to ask lawmakers for that power.The move means Winters-Johnson can't even ask for her license back until the suspension is over, while the commission could have allowed the teacher to seek reinstatement after half the penalty.""Yes, you can wipe out 20 years of experience in a minute, 20 seconds, because it doesn't take but one,"" Lee told the commission, rebutting Winters-Johnson's pleas.A Washington County grand jury indicted Winters-Johnson on a misdemeanor charge of abusing a vulnerable person.Winters-Johnson tried to argue that videos watched by millions were only part of the story, begging the commission to balance the act against her long years of service. She said she was trying to prevent the student from harming herself and that parts of the video were misleading. Winters-Johnson testified she did not forcefully strike the student with a metal cup, saying she only brushed the student's head ""in an exaggerated motion.""""I was there and I know I didn't hit her with the cup,"" Winters-Johnson said.She told the panel that she would accept its decision, but her lawyer said she'd consider an appeal to the state Board of Education.The daylong hearing ended with a withering cross-examination of Winters-Johnson by Lee, after the teacher said she acted after the student had been jumping on bleachers, digging through Winters-Johnson's belongings, and leaning on an exit door.""Do you have any remorse for your actions?"" Lee asked at one point.""I do,"" Winters-Johnson replied.""Would you like to start sharing that with the commission?"" Lee responded.The hearing also showed Winters-Johnson might have gotten off lightly if the videos hadn't surfaced.Greenville High School Principal Xavier Hodo immediately recommended Winters-Johnson be fired, after a meeting where he said Winters-Johnson told him she only grabbed the student's hair ""playfully"" and that ""this technique had worked in the past"" to calm the student.District leaders overrode Hodo and first opted for suspension, and Winters-Johnson said she felt at one point the incident ""would go away."" Former Superintendent Leeson Taylor, fired because school board members were displeased by his response, testified that he feared Winters-Johnson would appeal a firing and win. Taylor said he might have chosen not to renew Winters-Johnson's contract after the school year.""This was a situation where Ms. Johnson did not feel she needed to accept responsibility for her action until the world knew about it,"" Lee said.Paula Vanderford of the state Department of Education characterized the investigation as ""ongoing,"" meaning administrative charges could be filed against others. One question is whether any Greenville school employees deleted videos of Winters-Johnson's actions. The district also failed to report the incident to the state within the required 10 days.___Follow Jeff Amy at: http://twitter.com/jeffamy .

Why they can't have a five minute conversation or whatever it was to say congratulations doesn't make a lot of sense to me.â€ùâ€œI think the Trump administration will have to find whatever the right course is, and the right things during their administration, but I wouldn't prejudge what that would be right now,â€ù Jones said. â€œHe's not the president of the United States right now, he's the president- elect. He's talking to a lot of people around the world and that's not necessarily a bad thing.â€ùTrump is the first president or president-elect to speak with a Taiwanese leader since the United States broke-off relations with Taiwan in 1979 under President Jimmy Carter, when his administration established formal relations with Beijing, marking the start of the one-China policy.â€ùâ€œI think the policy is fine,â€ù Jones said. â€œI think we should lighten up a little bit about the importance of phone calls and signals that may or may not have been sent. I think policy is pretty stable and the Chinese relationship is very important.â€ùFor the first time, China sent a pair of bombers capable of launching nuclear weapons to circle Taiwan, two US officials tell Fox News. The incident occurred November 26, less than a week before Trump's controversial call Friday with the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, angering Chinese leaders who lodged a diplomatic protest the next day.Japan scrambled eight F-15 fighter jets to intercept the two Chinese H-6K bombers and their two escort planes at one point northeast of Taiwan, according to officials.Trump's response to critics of his phone call came in a tweet Friday.""Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.""U.S. arms sales to Taiwan have totaled more than $46 billion since 1990. In December 2015, the United States, under President Obama, announced a $1.83 billion arms sales agreement with Taiwan, the first arms sale in four years.Critics were outraged that Trump had broken decades-long policy by speaking with Taiwanâ€™s president. When asked on CBSâ€™s â€œFace the Nationâ€ù Sunday if he thought Trump was speaking to the leader of a sovereign nation, Trumpâ€™s future chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said, â€œHe knew exactly what was happening. But look, we have a lot of problems to solve in this country, and weâ€™re not going to solve them by just making believe that people donâ€™t exist. This is not a massive deviation of our policy.â€ùSince the Chinese civil war in the 1940s, China and Taiwan have been ruled separately. China claims sovereignty over the island.The White House was on the defensive Monday. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said officials had already made at least two calls to the Chinese.â€œI can confirm that U.S. officials, including senior officials on the national security council, been in touch with their Chinese counterparts to reiterate our countryâ€™s continued commitment to one-China policy,â€ù he said.Trade tariffs are another point of friction. China imposes a 25 percent tariff on imported cars, for instance, while the United States has either eliminated tariffs or charges two and a half percent or less for overseas products - a huge advantage for China.The flight around Taiwan consisted of two Chinese Xian H-6K bombers, along with two escort planes, a Tupolev Tu-154 and Shaanxi Y-8, flying around the island of Taiwan from mainland China, taking off and landing from two separate Chinese military bases.The escort jets were used to collect radar information and conduct other surveillance on American allies such as Japan, Fox News was told. The Chinese bombers stayed in international airspace, according to officials.At different points of the flight, Chinese J-10 and Su-30 fighter jets performed escort duties for the Chinese strategic bombers.""China has steadily built up a massive military capability in the area around Taiwan. This isn't simply a matter of flying bombers. Understand that technically, we can't object to flying bombers near Taiwan if we are flying combat aircraft and reconnaissance aircraft near China. This is simply legal under international law,"" said Anthony H. Cordesman, the Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.""Taiwan faces a much more serious Chinese challenge than it has ever faced before.""Jennifer Griffin currently serves as a national security correspondent for FOX News Channel .

The military shared the photo with wildlife officials including Game and Fish and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.Mark Hart, a spokesman for the Arizona Game and Fish Department, said jaguars migrate from Mexico to southern Arizona about every five to 10 years but that a female jaguar hasn't been spotted in the U.S. since the 1940s.""So the quality of life isn't here for the jaguar,"" Hart said.But Arizona, New Mexico and other parts of the Southwest were home to jaguars before habitat loss and predator control programs aimed at protecting livestock eliminated them over the last 150 years. A hunter shot and killed the last verified female jaguar in the U.S. in 1963 in northern Arizona.""It's so exciting that in the last 30 years or so, five or six males have shown up in the U.S. and are starting to re-establish themselves in the historical range,"" said Rob Peters, a biologist with Defenders of Wildlife who is based in Tucson. Peters says that although there haven't been any female jaguars here, the fact that males are establishing habitats is a good sign that they could come in the future.It could be days before experts determine whether the jaguar seen in a Dec. 1 photo is new.Hart says analysts will study the jaguar's rosettes, or the spots within the spots on the cat's fur, to figure out if it's been seen before.Peters says his organization is anxiously awaiting a report by the federal government that is expected to outline a jaguar recovery plan for the area.""They were once found in Arizona as far north as the Grand Canyon. There were females and cubs in the Southwest,"" Peters said.But protecting the big cats has been fraught with legal challenges.In March 2014, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service set aside nearly 1,200 square miles along the U.S.-Mexico border as habitat essential for the conservation of the jaguar. The New Mexico Farm and Livestock Bureau, New Mexico Cattle Growers' Association and New Mexico Federal Lands Council filed a lawsuit nearly a year later, saying the decision was ""unlawful, arbitrary and capricious"" action by federal authorities. That lawsuit is ongoing.Only El Jefe has made numerous appearances in the U.S. in several years. He first popped up in the Whetstone Mountains in 2011 when he was about 3 years old and showed up again in video in the Santa Rita Mountains south of Tucson around September 2015."foxnews,Sanders supporter: Time chose wrong Person of the Year,foxnews,Ambassador John Bolton On President Obamaâ€™s Final Days: A Pathetic Ending To A Pathetic Administration,"Ambassador John Bolton joined the John Gibson Show to discuss President Obamaâ€™s foreign policy speech, meeting with President Elect Trump about being the next Secretary of State and why he is impressed with Trumpâ€™s foreign policy being based on what is best for Americaâ€™s interestsListen here:"foxnews,TIME's Person of the Year: Donald Trump,"The ChoiceBY NANCY GIBBS, Time MagazineThis is the 90th time we have named the person who had the greatest influence, for better or worse, on the events of the year. So which is it this year: Better or worse? The challenge for Donald Trump is how profoundly the country disagrees about the answer.Itâ€™s hard to measure the scale of his disruption. This real estate baron and casino owner turned reality-TV star and provocateurâ€”never a day spent in public office, never a debt owed to any interest besides his ownâ€”now surveys the smoking ruin of a vast political edifice that once housed parties, pundits, donors, pollsters, all those who did not see him coming or take him seriously. Out of this reckoning, Trump is poised to preside, for better or worse.For those who believe this is all for the better, Trumpâ€™s victory represents a long-overdue rebuke to an entrenched and arrogant governing class; for those who see it as for the worse, the destruction extends to cherished norms of civility and discourse, a politics poisoned by vile streams of racism, sexism, nativism. To his believers, he delivers changeâ€”broad, deep, historic change, not modest measures doled out in Dixie cups; to his detractors, he inspires fear both for what he may do and what may be done in his name.The revolution he stirred feels fully American, with its echoes of populists past, of Andrew Jackson and Huey Long and, at its most sinister, Joe McCarthy and Charles Coughlin. Trumpâ€™s assault on truth and logic, far from hurting him, made him stronger. His appealâ€”part hope, part snarlâ€”dissolved party lines and dispatched the two reigning dynasties of U.S. politics. Yet his victory mirrors the ascent of nationalists across the world, from Britain to the Philippines, and taps forces far more powerful than one manâ€™s message.We can scarcely grasp what our generation has wrought by putting a supercomputer into all of our hands, all of the time. If you are reading this, whether on a page or a screen, there is a very good chance that you are caught up in a revolution that may have started with enticing gadgets but has now reshaped everything about how we live, love, work, play, shop, shareâ€”how our very hearts and minds encounter the world around us. Why would we have imagined that our national conversation would simply go on as before, same people, same promises, same patterns? Perhaps the President-elect will stop tweetingâ€”but only because he will have found some other means to tell the story he wants to tell directly to the audience that wants to hear it.It turned out to be a failing strategy when Hillary Clinton, who loves policy solutions and believes in them, tried to make this race a character test, a referendum on Trump. But it was certainly understandable. He presented so many challenges, so many choices about what America values. Her popular-vote victory, while legally irrelevant, affirmed the prospect of a female Commander in Chief. ..."foxnews,How Commoners And The Conquered Viewed Ancient Rome â€“ With Professor Mary Beard,"Ancient Rome continues to captivate and capture the attention of people worldwide 1600 years after Alaric and the Visigoths sacked the empireâ€™s western capitol.

It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the ""Harry Potter"" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it.The Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense.The Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers.Time Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers.Because of Time Warner's shows and movies â€” including ""Game of Thrones"" and the ""Harry Potter"" films â€” and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video.But many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition.Billionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor."foxnews,"Woman in love triangle admits to killing husband, mistress","A woman who prosecutors say was in a love triangle with her husband and their live-in mistress has pleaded guilty to her role in their slayings.The Anne Arundel County state's attorney's office said in a statement that 43-year-old Ann Anastasi pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder Wednesday.On Oct. 5, 2015, police found 40-year-old Anthony Anastasi Jr. fatally shot and 25-year-old Jacqueline Riggs stabbed to death in the basement of the home they shared with Ann Anastasi in Lothian.Prosecutors say the three were in a relationship, but Riggs and Anthony Anastasi moved together into the basement.Investigators say Ann Anastasi plotted with a 13-year-old girl and the girl's boyfriend, 18-year-old Gabriel Struss, to kill Anthony Anastasi and Riggs.

The courage I saw in our men was astonishing.Those gallant sailors fought back however they could. Pilots tried to locate airplanes that were still operable, but only a few managed to get in the air and into the fight.Gunners found themselves with only the ammunition in their ready boxes, with the rest of the munitions they so desperately needed locked up belowdecks.What happened on December 7, 1941, if it didnâ€™t kill us, changed us forever. President Roosevelt was right to call it â€œa date that will live in infamy.â€ù But for my fellow survivors and me, it also is alive in memory, like shrapnel left embedded in our brains because the surgeon thought it too dangerous to operate. These memories lie within me, forever still and silent, like the men entombed in the Arizona.If the bullets ran out, they raced to another gun, often one that had a fallen sailor crumpled beneath it.The rest of the men fought back with whatever weapons were at hand, shooting at the streaking Japanese Zeros with lightweight machine guns, rifles, even pistols.Acts of individual heroism could be witnessed everywhere you looked. Men being strafed as they brought boxes of ammo up ladders to the antiaircraft guns. Other men carrying their wounded buddies to safety, trying desperately to stanch their bleeding. Still others in small boats, navigating through the fiery sea, pulling oil-soaked sailors from the water. Many putting out fires on board their ships. All the while these men were dodging enemy bullets that were cutting everything around them to shreds, including their fellow sailors.We were not extraordinary men, those of us who fought on that infamous date in December seventy-five years ago.Truth be told, most of us had enlisted because there were precious few jobs to be found where we lived. The Great Depression had pulled the pockets of the economy inside out, leaving little more than a lintâ€™s worth of hope for the young men entering the workforce. Most of us who enlisted did so because we needed a job.Pearl Harbor changed that. A surge of patriotism swept the country, and everyone threw themselves into the war effort.Love for country welled up inside seemingly every American, coming out in the songs we sang, in the movies produced, in the newspaper articles that were written.We were ordinary men. What was extraordinary was the country we loved. We loved who she was, what she stood for. We loved her for what she meant to us, and for what she had given to us, even in those meager times.It didnâ€™t matter where you hailed from, whether you came from the mountains or the prairies, a sprawling city or a small coastal town: you loved her.We all didâ€”more than the states we left behind, our homes, the careers we gave up. As too many would prove, we loved her more than our very lives.The battleships and destroyers at Pearl Harbor were named after states from where some of us had been raised. Ohio. Tennessee. Oklahoma. Maryland. California. West Virginia. Utah. Nevada. Those vessels moored in that harbor so far from home reminded us where we came from.The battleship I served my country on was the USS Arizona.The men on that ship were drawn from different parts of the country. Some came from family farms in the Midwest. Some were fresh from the steel mills of Chicago. Others joined from dirt-poor towns in the Deep South. A few arrived with book smarts from places foreign to the rest of usâ€”Annapolis, Notre Dame, Vanderbilt.They came from different religious backgrounds. Some were Catholics, some Protestants, some Jews. Others werenâ€™t sure what they were. A few didnâ€™t care. After all, many were still teenagers with their whole lives stretching before them. There would be plenty of time for religion, later.They came from different ethnic backgrounds, too. Their accents betrayed them.There was a Jastrzemski from Michigan.An Oâ€™Bryan from Massachusetts.A Schroeder from New Jersey.A Giovenazzo from Illinois.A Riggins from California.A Nelson from Arkansas.Related Image Expand / ContractA Smith from just about everywhereâ€”Virginia, Missouri, Florida, Illinois, California, Ohio, Tennessee, Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi.And a Stratton from Nebraska.What happened on December 7, 1941, if it didnâ€™t kill us, changed us forever.President Roosevelt was right to call it â€œa date that will live in infamy.â€ù But for my fellow survivors and me, it also is alive in memory, like shrapnel left embedded in our brains because the surgeon thought it too dangerous to operate.Those images remain with us survivors seventy-five years later. Sometimes they intrude into our day, a moment spontaneously combusting, and suddenly we are back in the flames that engulfed our ship or in the oil-slick waters that surrounded it.Sometimes they come to us in the night, a haunt of images that troubles our sleep. Or perhaps the phone rings, and we flinch. Or a car backfires, and instinctively we duck.These memories lie within me, forever still and silent, like the men entombed in the Arizona. Others, like the oil that seeps from its wreckage, slip around inside me until they find a way out and make their way to the surface, where they pool and sometimes catch fire.Over the years, many of us made the pilgrimage back to that harbor, where we have experienced both the soothing of those wounds, and, at the same time, a reopening of them.Have some been healed? Yes. Year by merciful year. But all? No. And that is true for so many who have survived trauma, not just those who have survived the horror of war.With each anniversary our ranks thin.Three hundred thirty-five Arizona sailors survived that day.Only five remain.I am looking forward to reuniting with them on the seventy- fifth anniversary of Pearl Harbor in December 2016.Realistically, though, I realize I am about out of anniversaries. At ninety-four, I donâ€™t take the years ahead for granted. Not one.More than 65 percent of my body was burned in the explosion that sank the Arizona. My body is a patchwork of scars and skin grafts. Much of the feeling has come back. But not all.My joints are stiff, and I have to push myself up from my chair, then steady myself before I take the first tentative step.Itâ€™s been said that when an old person dies, it is like a library burning down. Having survived a fire that took so much from me, I have an obligation to save what memories I have from the flames that will one day come and claim what is left of me.I share what I remember when I can. But a day will come when I can no longer speak. What then? I have asked myself. What will become of the memories that I as a survivor have experienced? Or the lessons that we as a nation have learned?That is why I wrote my book, which we titled ""All the Gallant Men"" as tribute to those whose lives were claimed seventy five years ago.I wanted to save from the fire something of my memories of the Arizona so that younger generations, and all of the children to come after them, can understand why Pearl Harbor matters.Though my memory is pretty good, here and there I have needed to augment it with research, and I am indebted to those sources that helped clarify my recollections.Most of the memories are my own, but I didnâ€™t want the story to be exclusively mine.Itâ€™s important to me that the experiences of my shipmates and of other sailors, soldiers, and Marines who fought that day be included. They deserve to be heard, even though they are gone.Especially because they are gone.Excerpted from ""All the Gallant Men: An American Sailorâ€™s Firsthand Account of Pearl Harbor"" by Donald Stratton with Ken Gire. (William Morrow, November 22, 2016).Donald Stratton was a seaman first-class aboard the USS Arizona on December 7, 1941.

In the incident, captured on video, the TSA agent then goes back up and repeated the process along Albertâ€™s right leg.But when the agent moved her hands to her chest, Albert, co-host of a media company called â€œThe Moms,â€ù had had enough.â€œYou can't touch me there,â€ù she told the agent. â€œYou canâ€™t touch me there ... You canâ€™t touch me there.""Albert reiterated, ""Sorry â€_ I have breast cancer. I have a port in me. You canâ€™t touch me.â€ùA second agent moved in and told her: â€œSo, that is part of the procedure. We have to clear everything â€_ Sheâ€™s going to use as much pressure as she needs to, to clear the area. Thatâ€™s part of this. We have to make sure thereâ€™s nothing there.â€ùâ€œI was in such shockâ€_. I have never been so humiliated or felt more violated in my life,â€ù Albert, 41, wrote that night in a lengthy Facebook post that included a video of the incident.The mother of two sons, who has chronicled her battle with cancer in Good Housekeeping and writes a series called â€œDivorce Diariesâ€ù for the Huffington Post, continued:â€œI went through the scanning machine at the airport without incident. I had already told them about my metal port and my medical cream which I removed from my bag for them to see and test as I have done on prior flights.â€œI don't know what was different this time but TSA agents aggressively attempted to do a body cavity search in public. I was TSE precheck and once through the scanner they asked me to take off my shoes.â€œI explained I didn't have socks on and that my cream is for an infection from my current treatment, including on my feet. So if they wanted to put my shoes through x-ray, I would have to sit down because I would not put my bare feet on the floor. They allowed that.â€œThey then started to tell me they would apply pressure from head to toe and I got very upset because I wear a wig. I didn't want them to touch it, move it, or ruin it. So I ripped it off for them to pat my head â€_.â€œAfter at least 20 minutes of sitting there because they were debating how to proceed, I told them my feet were freezing. Also a side effect from chemo. They refused to help me.â€ùAfter several minutes, a supervisor finally arrived, took her to a private room and conducted a â€œregular soft pat down,â€ù Albert wrote. But her ordeal wasnâ€™t over.â€œâ€_ they opened my bags, removed everything and another TSA agent joked about all of the eyelashes I had. I told her, it's because I don't have real ones from my cancer treatment.â€ù""I started crying,"" Albert told PIX11, where she is a regular guest on the morning news. ""It was overwhelming and horrific. I could not believe what was happeningâ€_.In an updated Facebook post on Dec.5, Albert wrote that she has "" never been so humiliated or felt more violated in my life.""She said she has since filed an online complaint with the TSA and received a form response:â€œWe regret that you had a negative screening experience. While every person and item must be screened before entering a secured area, the manner in which the screening is conducted is important. Our policies and procedures focus on ensuring that all passengers, regardless of their personal situations and needs, are treated with dignity, respect, and courtesyâ€_.â€ùIn a statement sent to Pix11, the TSA wrote: â€œThe Transportation Security Administration takes reports of alleged impropriety very seriously. TSA is currently looking into the specific details as to what occurred during the screening process to ensure our security protocols were followed. We regret any distress the security screening process may have caused the passenger.

It therefore represents a vast possible resource for future astronauts exploring the Red Planet, study team members said.""This deposit is probably more accessible than most water ice on Mars, because it is at a relatively low latitude and it lies in a flat, smooth area where landing a spacecraft would be easier than at some of the other areas with buried ice,"" co-author Jack Holt, of the University of Texas, Austin, said in a statement. [Photos: The Search for Water on Mars]The researchers, led by Cassie Stuurman of the Institute for Geophysics at the University of Texas, analyzed observations of Mars' Utopia Planitia region made by the ground-penetrating Shallow Radar (SHARAD) instrument aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. They focused on this area because Utopia Planitia features ""scalloped depressions"" similar to landscapes in the Canadian Arctic that lie atop buried ice.Data gathered by SHARAD during 600 MRO passes over Utopia Planitia revealed the deposit between 39 and 49 degrees north latitude. The layer ranges in thickness from 260 feet to 560 feet and is made up of 50 to 85 percent water ice, researchers said. (The remainder is dirt and rock.)That puts the deposit's water volume roughly on a par with that of Lake Superior, the largest of the Great Lakes, which holds 2,900 cubic miles of the wet stuff.SHARAD is capable of distinguishing between layers of liquid and frozen water, and the instrument's data indicate that all of the Utopia Planitia water is ice at the moment. That's bad news for anyone hoping to find evidence of Mars life, because life here on Earth is intimately tied to liquid water.But there may have been some melting in the past, during times when Mars' poles were tilted at a different angle, researchers said. The planet has a 25-degree lean at the moment, but this axial tilt varies to about 50 degrees over a 120,000-year cycle.Indeed, the ice deposit probably formed during a high-tilt era, when snow accumulated at middle Martian latitudes rather than at the poles as it does now, Stuurman said. So further study of the Utopia Planitia ice deposit could also shed light on how the Martian climate has changed over the ages.""The ice deposits in Utopia Planitia aren't just an exploration resource, they're also one of the most accessible climate change records on Mars,"" co-author Joe Levy, also of the University of Texas, said in the same statement.""We don't understand fully why ice has built up in some areas of the Martian surface and not in others,"" Levy added. ""Sampling and using this ice with a future mission could help keep astronauts alive, while also helping them unlock the secrets of Martian ice ages.""The new study was published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters."foxnews,Phoenix police release 911 call from man fired upon by serial killer,"Phoenix police released a 911 recording Wednesday from a man who walked away uninjured from attack by a man believed to have fatally shot seven people and wounded two others earlier this year in a wave of serial killings.The 22-year-old man told an operator on July 11 that a man in an early 1990s black BMW opened fire as he and his 4-year-old nephew were driving home. He said he ducked down with the child and kept driving once he saw the gun.""He was driving around the corner and then he just like literally pulled out a gun and just shot on me while looking at me,"" the man said, noting later that none of the shots hit him or his nephew.The 911 recording from the shooting â€” the last confirmed attack by the suspect known as the Serial Street Shooter â€” was released as police say the number of tips coming in from the public has dwindled at an alarming rate.The cases remain a high priority for investigators, police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said. ""We feel there are people who either know who this man is or (have) strong suspicions,"" Howard said. ""We need those people to reach out to us to share their suspicions.""Police say the victims were attacked as they stood outside their homes or sat in vehicles after dark. They were fired upon by someone who was sitting in a car or had just stepped out of a vehicle. All but one of the killings has taken place in the city's Maryvale section, a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood Phoenix's west side.Investigators believe the crimes were carried out by a lanky Hispanic man in his early 20s, but they are leaving open the possibility that someone else may have participated in the attacks. They don't believe the attacks are racially motivated. No motive has been established.The victims include a 21-year-old man whose girlfriend was pregnant with their son and a 12-year-girl who was shot to death along with her mother and a friend of the woman.The July 11 shooting didn't occur in Maryvale, but rather in another neighborhood about 10 miles away.The 22-year-old victim didn't see the suspect's license plate number, but he caught a glimpse of the shooter, describing him as a Hispanic man in his early 20s who had short black hair. ""He saw me because I was riding with the windows down,"" the man told a 911 operator.Investigators found three bullet holes on the victim's car and recovered five shell casings from the scene, a police report says.In all, authorities say they have received more than 3,000 tips about the shootings that happened between March and July.Investigators are continuing to analyze physical evidence recovered from the scenes, seek out neighbors who might have security camera footage of the shootings and work with community groups to seek out useful information, Howard said.Tips that have already been investigated are being handed off to other officers to be re-examined in hopes that a fresh set of eyes will turn up something new.There are several theories on why the killer hasn't struck in nearly five months, including that he has decided to stop the attacks, has been locked up in jail for other reasons or moved to another location, Howard said.""We won't know what really happened until we capture him,"" he said."foxnews,Great Barrier Reef lost 22 percent of its coral this year,"This year saw the worst mass die-off of coral ever recorded at the Great Barrier Reef, with the ""most-pristine"" parts of the reef being hit the hardest, the Guardian reports.One 430-mile section in the northern portion of the 1,400-mile-long reef lost 67 percent of its shallow-water coral. All told, the Great Barrier Reef lost 22 percent of its coral in 2016's bleaching event.""To see those sections, two-thirds of the northern section, dead, is catastrophic,"" an Australian environmental minister tells the New York Times. The northern section of the reef had historically been the least damaged by human activity.The coral bleaching was caused by warming waters; the southern portion of the reef escaped great harm thanks to a cyclone that lowered water temperatures. This was the thirdâ€”and by far the worstâ€”coral bleaching event to hit the Great Barrier Reef in the past 18 years, the AP reports.Since the last event in 2002, the reef's coral had increased by 19 percent, according to the Australian government. Experts say it could take 10 to 15 years to regain the coral lost in this year's bleaching eventâ€”but that's assuming there isn't a fourth during that span.One expert says that even if the Great Barrier Reef hits pre-bleaching levels of coral, it will never regain the diversity it once had. The UN is considering adding the Great Barrier Reef to its list of world heritage sites that are in danger.And the Australian government plans to spent $1.5 billion on protecting the reef over the next decade.

What preceded that moment were numerous miles flown and driven across the United States to fulfill a promise Chris made when his daughter Kellisa exceeded doctorsâ€™ expectations to survive an extremely premature birthâ€” sustaining fluid on the brain and developing cerebral palsyâ€” about 17 and a half years ago.The symbolism of that sunrise wasnâ€™t lost on Chris, who at that moment was beginning the last chapter of a years-long journey to show Kellisa all 50 U.S. states before she turns 18.â€œIt was a huge relief because Iâ€™d been putting a lot of pressure on myself to make sure it happened,â€ù Chris, a technical manager for a company that supports the flooring industry, told FoxNews.com.Instead of keeping Kellisa indoors, Chris has prioritized father-daughter trips outdoors so Kellisa can live as normal a life as possible. The teen, who is reliant on a wheelchair and communicates primarily through facial expressions and basic phrases such as â€œyes,â€ù has always preferred bumpy terrain to smooth pavement anyway, Chris said.In December 2015, when FoxNews.com first spoke with Chris, he and Kellisa had hiked trails together in 47 states, and had only Iowa, Hawaii and Alaska left. But when Chris realized earlier this year that Kellisaâ€™s adopted sister, Laurel, 7, had visited 41 states, he decided to backtrack a bit to make it so his daughters could complete the feat together.â€œKellisa wants [Laurel] by her side,â€ù Chris said, and â€œLaurel has taken a very active role in wanting to help and watch out for Kellisa. She likes to help push Kellisa on these trails, and sheâ€™s real good at looking out for Kellisaâ€™s safety.â€ùTo catch Laurel up, Chris packed the girlsâ€™ bags plus Kellisaâ€™s jog stroller with rugged wheels to fly to Albany, New York, from the familyâ€™s new hometown of Roseville, California, where they relocated from Florida earlier this year, when Chris received a job transfer. In three days, they traversed the Northeast by carâ€” hitting New York, Massachusetts, Vermont and New Hampshireâ€” and flew to Illinois before finally driving to Iowa. Cramming six states into that time span was unusual, but doing a lot in a little wasnâ€™t atypical for the girls.â€œTheyâ€™re both road warriors,â€ù Chris said.The following week, Chris and his wife, Lisa, flew their daughters to Oahu, where they hiked muddy trails as it drizzled, and spent five days feasting their eyes on aerial views of Honolulu and Waikiki, as well as playing on sandy beaches. From Hawaii, the Kains took an overnight flight to Anchorage, where an abundant snowfall made up for the limited trail options in the wintertime.â€œNegative 14 degrees was the actual temperatureâ€” both kids loved it,â€ù Chris said. â€œLaurel got out of the car and was [making] a snowball, Kellisaâ€™s giggling â€_ I was very impressed that they did not let the cold slow them down or stop them one bit. I had to kind of drag them back into the car because they wanted to keep playing.â€ùThe Kains spent four days in Alaska, and now that their nationwide tour is over, Chris is already setting his sights on hiking trails outside of the U.S.â€œTheyâ€™ve both been to Canada, but they havenâ€™t been to all the providences, so Iâ€™m thinking we can do that and do some trails in each of them,â€ù Chris said.However, in her new home state, Kellisa has all the advantages of the outdoors that many of her nationwide excursions have afforded. Lately, the Cains have been spending their time exploring local trails, sledding the Sierra Nevada Mountains, and splashing around in swimming holes and creeks in which Kellisa uses a square flotation device that allows her to independently move her hands and lightly kick her feet.â€œMy kids thrive in this stuff,â€ù he said. â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter if itâ€™s hot or cold or in between, or wet or dryâ€” just that theyâ€™re doing something.â€ùChris re-emphasized his goal of inspiring other parents whose children are disabled to believe in their kids and push to give them more than only what is expected.â€œI see [my kids] thriving and all the kids who are sitting there at home,â€ù he said. â€œThatâ€™s the bigger goal: to inspire people not necessarily to do what we do, but to do something.â€ù"foxnews,Charges possible over video of black student eating chicken,"A Pennsylvania teenager accused of producing a racist video of a black classmate eating chicken and posting it online could face criminal charges.Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli said Wednesday he's considering ethnic intimidation and harassment charges against a white 14-year-old student at Saucon Valley High School.Morganelli says the teenager recorded a 16-year-old black boy eating chicken wings and in narrating the video called the older boy the N-word and made references to ""being broke and on welfare.""Morganelli calls the video ""reprehensible"" and ""repulsive.""

After brief deliberations, a three-commissioner panel voted to bar Winters-Johnson from the classroom for 12 years.Raina Lee, a lawyer who handles educator misconduct proceedings for the state, said it was the longest such sanction she'd seen. Mississippi has no legal provisions for permanently revoking a teacher's license, although department officials say they plan to ask lawmakers for that power.The move means Winters-Johnson can't even ask for her license back until the suspension is over, while the commission could have allowed the teacher to seek reinstatement after half the penalty.""Yes, you can wipe out 20 years of experience in a minute, 20 seconds, because it doesn't take but one,"" Lee told the commission, rebutting Winters-Johnson's pleas.A Washington County grand jury indicted Winters-Johnson on a misdemeanor charge of abusing a vulnerable person.Winters-Johnson tried to argue that videos watched by millions were only part of the story, begging the commission to balance the act against her long years of service. She said she was trying to prevent the student from harming herself and that parts of the video were misleading. Winters-Johnson testified she did not forcefully strike the student with a metal cup, saying she only brushed the student's head ""in an exaggerated motion.""""I was there and I know I didn't hit her with the cup,"" Winters-Johnson said.She told the panel that she would accept its decision, but her lawyer said she'd consider an appeal to the state Board of Education.The daylong hearing ended with a withering cross-examination of Winters-Johnson by Lee, after the teacher said she acted after the student had been jumping on bleachers, digging through Winters-Johnson's belongings, and leaning on an exit door.""Do you have any remorse for your actions?"" Lee asked at one point.""I do,"" Winters-Johnson replied.""Would you like to start sharing that with the commission?"" Lee responded.The hearing also showed Winters-Johnson might have gotten off lightly if the videos hadn't surfaced.Greenville High School Principal Xavier Hodo immediately recommended Winters-Johnson be fired, after a meeting where he said Winters-Johnson told him she only grabbed the student's hair ""playfully"" and that ""this technique had worked in the past"" to calm the student.District leaders overrode Hodo and first opted for suspension, and Winters-Johnson said she felt at one point the incident ""would go away."" Former Superintendent Leeson Taylor, fired because school board members were displeased by his response, testified that he feared Winters-Johnson would appeal a firing and win. Taylor said he might have chosen not to renew Winters-Johnson's contract after the school year.""This was a situation where Ms. Johnson did not feel she needed to accept responsibility for her action until the world knew about it,"" Lee said.Paula Vanderford of the state Department of Education characterized the investigation as ""ongoing,"" meaning administrative charges could be filed against others. One question is whether any Greenville school employees deleted videos of Winters-Johnson's actions. The district also failed to report the incident to the state within the required 10 days.___Follow Jeff Amy at: http://twitter.com/jeffamy .

BPS, a chemical that replaced BPA because experts believed it wouldnâ€™t leak into drinks as much as BPA didâ€” which later was proven wrongâ€” has been found to cause developmental issues in fish embryos. BPF is another replacement for BPA.â€œThese alternatives [to BPA] are equally toxic, or in some cases, more toxic,â€ù study author Kurunthachalam Kannan, a research scientist at the New York State Department of Health, told FoxNews.com.Parabens are commonly used as a preservative in teethers that are water- or gel-filled to prevent the likely growth of microorganisms. Triclosan and triclocarban are two of the most common ingredients found in antibacterial hand and body wash. In September, the FDA banned some of these antibacterial products because they could cause long-term harm, such as bacterial resistance or hormonal effects.Forty-eight of the studied teethers were labeled BPA-free or non-toxic.The teethers, which were manufactured by 23 brands, also leached chemicals when exposed to water, which was used to mimic saliva. Study authors noted a German study previously measured paraben levels found in baby teethers, but the sample only included 10 products and did not analyze chemical leaching.The plastics industry claims the amount of BPA used in baby and child care products does not present a health risk, but Kannan said recent studies have suggested that even at a nanogram or microgram level, the chemical can be harmful. Regulation is hazy, Kannan said, because the levels are still being debated and standards are not clearly described.The teamâ€™s findings arenâ€™t entirely surprising, said Dr. Josef George Thundiyil, a medical toxicologist and emergency medicine specialist at Orlando Health, who was not involved in the study.â€œIf you take urine samples, about 90 percent of Americans will have [BPA] in our bodies,â€ù he told FoxNews.com.In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that BPA could no longer be used in baby bottles and sippy cups. This change was not made for safety but because BPA was no longer deemed necessary as a food additive, according to the FDA.There are many substances that could be toxic at the right doseâ€” including waterâ€” but itâ€™s unclear where that number lands for these chemicals, Thundiyil said.â€œWhat the FDA has concluded is that at current doses, this doesnâ€™t appear to be a danger. Where we get the most concerned is when we look at toxicity in those that are most vulnerableâ€” young kids and unborn fetuses,â€ù Thundiyil said. â€œThe question is: Is there a safe dose for a developing child or fetus that might be exposed to this [chemical] that might affect development, hormonal changes, or ongoing developmental issues?â€ùOne explanation for the lack of a recommended dosage for children may be that it is difficult to study this particular demographic, Thundiyil noted. Scientists have gained insight from animal studiesâ€” several show toxicity from BPAâ€” but whether these data apply to humans has yet to be determined.â€œThere are studies that show the link between the chemical and different outcomes, but a link isnâ€™t always clearly established as being the causeâ€” thatâ€™s where the gray area lies,â€ù he said.Plus, since BPA was removed from baby bottles and cups, the FDA and other organizations have no longer been able to assess a childâ€™s lifetime exposure because that part of the equation was removed, Thundiyil said, adding that the studyâ€™s finding of EDCs in teething rings may lead researchers to re-account for that exposure.To simulate leaching of chemicals in saliva, the American Chemical Society team immersed each teether in 200 mL of water for an hour to mimic a childâ€™s daily use and measured for 26 potential EDCs.They found that parabens were the most commonly leached, with a range of one-tenth to one-hundreth of a nanogram. The max value measured was 2,000 nanograms.Based on estimates of the body weight of a 12-month-old baby, the teamâ€™s calculations suggest that levels of BPA and other regulated EDCs in teethers were lower than those of what European regulators consider safe. However, these thresholds are set for individual compounds, and regulations donâ€™t account for accumulation of multiple EDCs.â€œIf weâ€™re looking at all different types of chemicals presentâ€” several hundreds of nanograms up to a microgramâ€” many of these chemicals have been shown to be toxic, even at low levels of exposure,â€ù Kannan said. â€œPutting this cocktail of chemicals, even in low amounts, during critical stages of development of many organs, can have an effect in many stages of life.â€ùHe said research suggests multiple, environmentally mediated diseases, including neurodevelopmental issues, diabetes and obesity, that may result from EDC exposure.â€œThatâ€™s why weâ€™re concerned about itâ€” the early-life exposure and epigenetic changes that results from the EDCs can contribute to some of the disease and development of some of these diseases later in life,â€ù Kannan said, referring to the study of how genes can change their expression and may influence health outcomes.â€œWe should have policies limiting exposure,â€ù he said.Thundiyil also expressed skepticism.â€œItâ€™s always difficult proving what kind effect might occur in combination,â€ù Thundiyil said. â€œ[Weâ€™re] not being exposed to chemicals in a vacuum; weâ€™re being exposed to chemicals along with other chemicals. It leaves a big unknown void about the potential interaction and interplay between that substance and another substance that child is being exposed to.â€ùBut Thundiyil was most concerned by the fact that most of the products analyzed in the study were labeled as BPA-free or non-toxic.â€œâ€™Non-toxicâ€™ can be a very broad designation to state something might have some toxin present, but not at a level that is toxic,â€ù he said. â€œApplied to a single person, thatâ€™s OK. When you take the same device and apply it over a population, there will be those that use it infrequently, those that use it continuously, those that might use it in ways that are unanticipated, such as using heat to boil, which can enhance the release of [chemicals]. Thatâ€™s what makes it a concern.â€ùâ€œUsually when the FDA makes what we call risk assessments, they usually build those uncertainties in it â€_ to account for different methods of use, ages, long-term exposure,â€ù Thundiyil said.Regardless of whether we realize it, weâ€™re all exposed to a small amount of a variety of substances, Thundiyil said. â€œTheyâ€™re a part of life, what makes things function, what makes a lot of modern conveniences work the way they do.â€ùKannan said he did not think EDCs posed an immediate threat to babies, but he suggested parents use frozen waffles as an alternative to plastic teethers, or rinsing the teether with water to possibly help leach possible chemicals.Thundiyil said parents may consider limiting their childrenâ€™s use of teething rings or to use alternatives, but to be mindful of other concrete areas of risk.â€œIn some ways itâ€™s probably more important to make sure to have your child wear a helmet for bicycling and buckle in their seatbelt,â€ù he said. â€œAt the end of the day, those risks are probably higher while others exist, but are still theoretical. Itâ€™s important not to neglect the things we know cause injury and harm.â€ùThe American Chemistry Council, an industry trade association, said the study ""provides very little useful information for the parents of young children, as it focuses on the mere presence of chemicals, which parents should be reassured does not equate with harm."" In a statement emailed to FoxNews.com, a representative noted that the organization was not aware of any use for BPA or materials made from BPA being used in teethers."foxnews,The incredible secret weapon Trump brings to US-China relations (and why matters),"Several U.S. media outlets have picked up on the story of Donald Trumpâ€™s rising popularity in China â€“ one of the countries that he represented most negatively during his presidential campaign.Since doing political opinion polls in China is not a viable option, most reporters interested in what the Chinese people might think about a given topic tend to rely on the countryâ€™s vibrant social media, especially the Weibo platform, which is like a mixture of Twitter and Facebook and circulates millions of short messages and images per day.PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP'S THREE GREATEST CHALLENGESWeibo is censored by the Chinese government, for sure, but research has shown that frank opinions about political leaders can be freely expressed on these microblogs, as long as they do not go accompanied by calls for public action. Frank opinions about foreign government leaders are even less censored, so social media trends in China can be a pretty good indicator of what educated Chinese urbanites (the majority of Weibo users) think about Donald Trump.China is pursuing what is called a â€œsoft powerâ€ù policy, using initiatives in the teaching of Chinese language and culture to non-Chinese people as a mechanism to foster a deeper understanding of what motivates the country, its people, and especially its leaders, in the hope of eventually presenting a perspective on the world that is persuasive enough to cast doubt on the dominant model of capitalist democracy.Well, it would seem that many of them love him, at least if we judge by the fact that a video in which his granddaughter Arabella Kushner recites a Chinese poem has gone viral.The video was recorded in February 2016, around the time of the Chinese New Year, and put on Instagram by Arabellaâ€™s mother Ivanka Trump. It drew attention in China back in February but has gone viral in China since Donald Trump won the November 8 election.Five-year-old Arabella has not lived in China but has apparently been learning Chinese with a Chinese nanny. In the short video, we see and hear Arabella reciting the poem â€œSympathy for the Peasants,â€ù as well as the first two lines of the poem â€œOde to the Geese.â€ù Both are perennial favorites written during the Tang dynasty (618-907 CE) and continue to be routinely memorized by schoolchildren across China.â€œSympathy for the Peasantsâ€ù is also popular for ideological reasons, because its theme (hardship among workers in the countryside) can be put to good use in education about the common peopleâ€™s suffering in China in â€œfeudalâ€ù times â€“ from which the people were of course liberated by the Communist Party.Tang-dynasty poetry is viewed by Chinese people as one of its cultureâ€™s highest achievements, if not the highest. It would be unthinkable for any public figure, including political leaders, not to be able to recite at least some of the most canonical Tang poems and to refer to them in speeches and in conversation.Those same Chinese political leaders, when visiting Western countries, have in recent years been prone to comment on the fact that westerners know so little about Chinese culture.When former Premier Wen Jiabao visited the U.K. in 2011, he spoke about his love of Shakespeare, as well as his disappointed that none of his Western counterparts were familiar with any of the literary giants of his own country.Wen was quoted at the time as saying: â€œOnly those political leaders who respect the history of other countries and the creativity of the people of other countries will be able to lay a foundation for fostering friendship with other countries.â€ùChina is pursuing what is called a â€œsoft powerâ€ù policy, using initiatives in the teaching of Chinese language and culture to non-Chinese people as a mechanism to foster a deeper understanding of what motivates the country, its people, and especially its leaders, in the hope of eventually presenting a perspective on the world that is persuasive enough to cast doubt on the dominant model of capitalist democracy.Boosting the status of Mandarin as a global language, like English, is part and parcel of that initiative, and what better way of illustrating this than having the granddaughter of the president-elect reciting Tang poetry with a very good pronunciation.Amidst all the hard-headed posturing towards China as trade enemy and â€œcurrency manipulator,â€ù the surprising popularity of this video, and its message of respect for Chinaâ€™s cultural achievements, may well signal an opening in U.S.-China relations that few will have expected but that is not to be underestimated.Michel Hockx is a professor of Chinese Literature and Director of the Liu Institute for Asia and Asian Studies in Notre Dame's new Keough School of Global Affairs. He is a specialist in Chinese poetry and an experienced observer and analyst of China's soft power initiatives."foxnews,Sears is on the brink of catastrophe as stores closures loom and top execs flee the company,"Before you go, we thought you'd like these...Things aren't looking good for Sears.The company is shutting down dozens of Kmart stores this month and two of its highest-ranking executives left this week in the midst of the key holiday shopping season.This comes following speculation among Sears and Kmart employees, suppliers, and several banks that the retailer will soon go bankrupt â€” something Sears has repeatedly dismissed.Jeff Balagna, formerly Sears' executive vice president, left the company Wednesday, ""in order to focus on his other business interests and pursue other career opportunities,"" Sears said in an SEC filing dated November 23.Balagna did not respond to a request for comment.

While they canâ€™t be positive, they think the bones, which are over 3,200 years old, are indeed Nefertariâ€™s.Nefertari, if you need to brush up on your ancient Egyptian politics, was the wife of King Ramses II.

But are those leg bones, which reside at the Egyptian Museum in Turin, Italy, actually the queenâ€™s?The scientists did x-rays, radiocarbon dating, chemical analysis, and more.

Half the group will be assessed for eating problems and receive customized meals, while the rest will get just the nutrition counseling that NYU typically provides its cancer patients.Click for more from the Wall Street Journal."foxnews,Workers at O'Hare airport expected to strike over wages,"Workers at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport are expected to walk off the job over union rights and an hourly wage of $15.About 500 workers have committed to the strike on Tuesday.

In an alert sent to doctors, the cityâ€™s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene urged vigilance and continued to discourage women from traveling to areas battling the virus, The New York Times reported.According to Wednesdayâ€™s alert, since July, at least four babies have been born in New York City with Zika-related symptoms, which can include microcephaly, in which the childâ€™s brain is severely underdeveloped. The Department of Health reported the first case of a baby born in New York City with microcephaly on July 22.The New York Times reported that, as of Dec. 2, 962 city residents tested positive for Zika, including 325 pregnant women.â€œTodayâ€™s news is a reminder that Zika continues to be a threat to pregnant women and their babies,â€ù said the cityâ€™s health commissioner, Dr. Mary T.

[Spooky! Top 10 Unexplained Phenomena]The new findings could help researchers calculate exactly where the Earth's center of mass lies, which could provide a sanity check for ultra-precise GPS and satellite measurements.Moving with the seasonsHan and his colleagues wanted to get a better handle on how Australia moves with the motion of water in and around the continent. Though Earth looks like a sphere, it's actually a little lopsided, with the distribution of water and continental crust shifting its center of mass (CM) slightly, the researchers said.""I was looking into ground deformation induced by local climate"" in Australia, Han told Live Science in an email. But as he began crunching numbers, he realized that the effect of global water movement (in the world's oceans) seemed to be as important as local water movement (in and around Australia).Fourteen GPS stations across Australia show the direction of the continentï¿_ï¿_ï¿_s shift from month to month. Shin-Chan HanThe scientists looked at data from land-based GPS stations that tracked minute movements of less than a millimeter. From there, the team looked at data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), which calculates the change in the Earth's gravitational pull from two satellites in space, and uses that to determine where water is located on the planet. By taking the difference between the two, researchers can calculate where the center of the mass is at any given time, and how much the continent was moving as a result of global effects.The continent moved northwest by a millimeter during Australia's summer (winter in the Northern Hemisphere), with its northwestern edge lifting up. Meanwhile, the opposite corner of the continent goes up by 2 to 3 millimeters during this same time. Six months later, during Australia's winter, the trends reverse, the researchers reported in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth.Mass migrationHan found that much of Australia's motion was caused by the movement of Earth's water in locations far from the continent. For instance, in the Northern Hemisphere's winter, the vast accumulation of ice and snow up north shifts Earth's center of gravity north. Once all that water melts, it evaporates into the atmosphere and the center of mass migrates closer to the South Pacific. Australia sits smack in between these two areas, Han said.""Australia is in between two peaks and thus suffers from large extensional stress,"" meaning it is always chasing the center of mass, in a sense, Han added. Still, ""all continents will be affected by this global pattern of mass migration (CM motion) to different extents,"" Han said.The new findings also suggest Australia's GPS instruments could be off by as much as a millimeter. While that may not seem like much, it could have impacts in tracking sea- level rise. For instance, deep ocean heights are measured by satellites, while coastal areas are tracked by tide gauges on the ground. Having a better understanding of how the Earth's center of mass migrates may improve how those measurements are reconciled, Han said.""This is systematic distortion,"" Han said. ""When dealing with [millimeter]-level precision positioning, this should be understood and removed.""Original article on Live Science.Editor's Recommendations"foxnews,Source: Trump picks Scott Pruitt to lead EPA,foxnews,Video Technology,"Want to know how to hide online shopping purchase during the holidays, the best tablet apps for Mom, and how to broadcast using Facebook Live?

It was so unexpected ... It looks a lot like Brexit â€_ Who will Trump pick? How will his election impact monetary policy, taxes, the wall, China, and financial regulation? We had those same questions too, so we turned to the TabbFORUM community, leaders in the capital markets, to get the pulse of our industry.Continue Reading BelowFrom November 28 through December 1, 2016, we polled 370 people in the TabbFORUM financial markets community about President-elect Trumpâ€™s proposals and what they meant to them, the markets and their organizations. Forty-four percent of respondents worked for banks, brokers, exchanges, market makers, or professional money managers; 3% were academics or regulators; 35% were vendors and/or consultants; and 18% either didnâ€™t specify their positions or checked â€œother.â€ù What follows is a summary of the results. The complete results can be found at TabbFORUM.In brief, the financial community, while having trepidations about a Trump presidency, has come around to the opportunities aligned with audacious infrastructure spending proposals, lower taxes, higher debt, the reduction of quantitative easing programs, reduced financial regulations, and a more business-friendly environment. While the community continues to be concerned by the potential civil, social, and macroeconomic impacts of some of President-elect Trumpâ€™s campaign promises, the climate has changed from one of concern to one of mild, if not restrained, optimism.The greatest consensus from the survey was that financial regulation will be watered down and banks will be the beneficiary, as 86% of the community felt that financial regulation will decline and 82% felt that banks would be winners. Seventy-four percent of the sample believed Dodd-Frank would be repealed. If Dodd-Frank were repealed, the environment could be significantly altered for the large banks, depending upon what rules were implemented in its wake (only 28% believed Glass-Steagall would be reinstated).There was significant optimism among respondents that Trumpâ€™s large infrastructure proposal and promise of reduced regulation would change the outlook for active investment strategies, as market participants believed that active management and hedge funds would benefit more from these policies than long-only, ETF and passive strategies.The community indicated that it believes that the new administrationâ€™s policies would benefit energy, equities, metals, and the US Dollar, while negatively impacting the rates market, credit, and housing.Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENTWhile the industry is optimistic on the new administrationâ€™s investment and regulatory policies, there are significant macroeconomic and societal concerns. The greatest concerns are: increased market volatility (89%), an increase in trade barriers (81%), the risk of armed conflict (73%), a reduction of international cooperation (77%), increased budgetary/debt worries (68%), the overall stability of the global financial markets (66%), and a reduction of economic equality (59%). In addition, the respondents believed that the nation will become more socially conservative (54%), and that social harmony and tranquility will decline (73%).The two conflicting themes market participants voiced in regards to a Trump presidency were that the alignment of the executive branch, the House and the Senate, and presumably the Supreme Court will reduce governmental gridlock, while the industry is worried that the President-electâ€™s business engagements will create significant challenges within the administration.We also asked our community about their views of the top Trump campaign promises (as defined by PolitiFact) and whether they believed that we should follow the pledges and whether the new administration will follow the pledges. The gap between â€œshouldâ€ù and â€œwillâ€ù defines the level of anticipated frustration over the lack of fulfilling what would be considered a positive promise versus the worry about executing on plans that the community feels to be an overreach.One of the President-electâ€™s major proposals was a promise to build up Americaâ€™s manufacturing base by renegotiating trade deals, stopping illegal immigration, and imposing tariffs on imported goods. The TabbFORUM community was heavily aligned with trying to bring back manufacturing jobs, but it was much more skeptical that we will be able to execute on this promise. The community also supported building a wall along the Mexico border, but only a handful believed that we should or will make Mexico pay for it.The community was much less aligned with the President-elect on trade, as there was a much greater worry that the administration would actually act on its campaign promises to renegotiate/withdraw from NAFTA and renegotiate/withdraw from the TPP. There was a very large disconnect regarding whether we should impose tariffs on goods made in China and Mexico.The community also expressed little support to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the US; however, the community largely believed we will implement such a ban. Approximately half said that we should renegotiate the Iranian nuclear arms treaty, with a larger split in the view that we should bomb ISIS.As for domestic policies, there is little desire/belief in repealing Obamacare; however, there is much more significant desire to implement a more market-based Obamacare alternative. A majority of the community believed we should implement a lower tax policy, while an overwhelming majority of the community believed we actually would. In addition, less than half of the community supported leaving social security alone, while two-thirds believed the administration actually would, leading us to the impression that the community was very worried about what the impact of tax cuts and the inability to address pending social security challenges would have on our financial solvency.The Bottom LineOur TabbFORUM community is excited but concerned about the future of our country. While the reduction of regulations, the expectation of fiscal stimulus, and the alignment of all branches of our government point toward a reinvigorated financial sector, leading to better energy, equity, and metals markets, it comes with greater geopolitical, economic, social, human rights, and budgetary risks that weigh heavy across the industry.How these factors translate into reality unfortunately is unknown. It is too soon to tell which policies and initiatives will be implemented and which will be sidelined, which will be positive and which negative. The one thing we do know is that change â€“ massive change â€“ is on the way. How far we get is now up to the President-elect, his administration, Congress, and us. While Smokey the Bear reminded us, â€œOnly you can prevent forest fires,â€ù that also pertains to our government. We the people, through the political process, do have the ability to change our future, and while it may be too late to vote in this election, it is certainly not too late to make our voices heard.Larry Tabb is founder and chairman of TABB Group"foxnews,Why is it snowing in Hawaii?,foxnews,President-elect Trumpâ€™s Time Magazineâ€™s â€˜Person of the Yearâ€™,"â€œTimeâ€ù magazine has named President-elect Donald Trump as its Person of the Year, calling him â€œPresident of the Divided States of Americaâ€ù.FOXâ€™s Rachel Sutherland reports from Washington:Mr. Trump says the country was already divided and heâ€™s vowing to put it back together.He also told the NBC â€œToday Showâ€ù heâ€™s getting closer to naming his pick for Secretary of State and talked about his expanded pool of candidates, including Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson:(President-elect Trump) â€œHeâ€™s built a tremendous company over the a period of years, with great style.â€ùThe President-elect said heâ€™s not holding a grudge against Mitt Romney for saying negative things about him:(President-elect Trump) â€œItâ€™s not about revenge, itâ€™s about whatâ€™s good for the country.â€ùHe confirmed Romney is still under consideration, and said an announcement on Secretary of State could come next week.Iowa Governor Terry Branstad is Mr. Trumpâ€™s choice to be Ambassador to China.In Washington, Rachel Sutherland, FOX News.Follow Rachel Sutherland on Twitter: @SutherlandFOX"foxnews,Imagine Dragons lead singer lends voice to â€˜hidden diseaseâ€™,foxnews,Recount is Under Way in Michigan,"The 2016 election recount effort is shifting to Michigan and Pennsylvania.FOXâ€™s Tonya J.

The court said Stein, who finished fourth in Michigan on Nov. 8, didn't have a chance of winning even after a recount and therefore isn't an ""aggrieved"" candidate.""Because there is no basis for this court to ignore the Michigan court's ruling and make an independent judgment regarding what the Michigan Legislature intended by the term 'aggrieved,' plaintiffs have not shown an entitlement to a recount,"" Goldsmith said.It was the judge's midnight ruling Monday that started the recount in Michigan. But Goldsmith's order dealt with timing â€” not whether a recount was appropriate. More than 20 of 83 counties already were counting ballots again. They reported minor changes in vote totals, although many precincts couldn't be examined for a second time for a variety of reasons.Earlier Wednesday, the Michigan elections board voted, 3-1, to end the recount if Goldsmith extinguished his earlier order.State Republican Party Chairman Ronna Romney McDaniel and Attorney General Bill Schuette said it's a victory for voters and taxpayers. Stein now is left with asking the Michigan Supreme Court to intervene, which is a long shot.""Jill Stein, who received only 1.07% of the vote in Michigan, is not legally entitled to hijack the will of voters and drag them into an arduous and expensive publicity stunt,"" McDaniel said.Stein got about 1 percent of the vote in three states where she's pushed for recounts â€” Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump narrowly won all three.She insists she's more concerned about the accuracy of the election, but Goldsmith said Stein's legal team presented only ""speculative claims"" about vulnerable machines, ""not actual injury.""The judge said a recount to test the integrity of the voting system ""has never been endorsed by any court.""A court hearing will be held Friday on a possible recount in Pennsylvania. Wisconsin's recount, which started last week, has increased Trump's margin of victory over Clinton thus far.Clinton needed all three states to flip in order to take enough electoral votes to win the election. Trump has 306 electoral votes to Clinton's 232; 270 are needed to win. Michigan has 16 electoral votes, Pennsylvania has 20 and Wisconsin has 10.

John Kasich that would prohibit abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected.A House committee voted Wednesday night to pass the 20-week ban, which now heads to the full House for consideration Thursday.That follows House approval Tuesday night of the so-called heartbeat bill, clearing the way for what would be one of the nation's most stringent abortion restrictions.That legislation would prohibit most abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy after the first detectable heartbeat.Kasich, an abortion-rights opponent, has previously voiced concerns about whether such a move would be constitutional. He has not said whether he plans to sign the measure.State Senate President Keith Faber, a Republican from Celina, said the twice-defeated bill came back up again because of Republican Donald Trump's presidential victory and the expectation he will fill Supreme Court vacancies with justices who are more likely to uphold stricter abortion bans.Asked if he expects the Ohio proposal to survive a legal challenge, Faber said: ""I think it has a better chance than it did before.""The ban would make an exception if the mother's life is in danger but not in cases of rape or incest, he said.NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio said the move would block access to abortion before most women even know they're pregnant.Under the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling establishing a nationwide right to abortion, states were permitted to restrict abortions after viability â€” the point when the fetus has a reasonable chance of surviving under normal conditions outside the uterus.The ruling offered no legal definition of viability, saying it could range from 24 to 28 weeks into a pregnancy."foxnews,"Netscape Co-Founder Clark: The Password is PassÃ©, Time for a Reboot","President-elect Trump may need to add purging the password to his long â€˜To-Doâ€™ list.

The outdated technology is costing individuals and corporations billions as they deal with cyber-hacking, identity theft and in the case of the Democratic National Committeeâ€™s e-mail hack earlier this year, possibly even influencing voter sentiment ahead of the 2016 presidential election.â€œPasswords are easy to guess, often, and you have to share it with the site you are logged into so the site has a copy, you have a copy and all it takes is the breach of a siteâ€ù to be compromised, warned former Netscape Co-Founder Jim Clark during a sit down with FOXBusiness.com.The tech pioneer, who founded Netscape along with Marc Andreessen which was later sold to AOL (VZ) in 1998, says his company developed a solution 20-years ago. Known as Transport Layer Security (TLS), the technology uses â€œPublic Key Certificatesâ€ù [developed at MIT in the late 70â€™s] to make the authentication and encryption process automatic.â€œThe certificate is a signed, kind of a notarized digital passport you canâ€™t alter and you get to share with everyone, and if everyone knows your Certificate they can send you messages encrypted with thatâ€_In the case of a web site [that] has a Certificate, when you log into the web site and you connect to that website it automatically verifies that [it] is the proper website and you canâ€™t be spoofedâ€ù explains Clark.Clark notes the technology, when developed years ago, was ahead of its time. However, as the password proves easier prey for hackers, and tech infrastructure becomes more advanced, Clark says a wider-adoption of Certificates is a no-brainer.Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENTâ€œI was frustrated so I started this new company called CommandScape and I said guys we are going to use a Certificate like it is supposed to be used, we are going to give our users Certificates so theyâ€™ll never have to type in a passwordâ€ù he said.Certificates run and are supported by Amazon Web services (AMZN) via a log-in connection facility. You can use your phone to go to your home or business digitally via the cloud [simply a remote computer] and you specify your destination. Then you are connected and authenticated by the siteâ€™s server. No password needed.While the U.S. has yet to widely adopt the password-less technology other countries are getting on board. The German government for example is among the countries using Certificates when citizens file their taxes.While passwords at one time were the near-perfect protection, the technology has not kept pace with the exploding internet and ballooning world of the cloud. Even changing your password multiple times a year doesnâ€™t cut it anymore. So why are banks, companies and workplaces still using them?â€œMany of these corporations donâ€™t realize you can actually issue certificates for usersâ€_. and to a certain degree theyâ€™re lazy, it means making a big changeâ€ù laments Clark.Suzanne Oâ€™Halloran is Managing Editor of FOXBusiness.com and a graduate of Boston College.

European plane manufacturer Airbus, along with U.S. aerospace and defense company Boeing (BA), were both given the greenlight to sell aircraft to Iran earlier this year.Boeing, which has been a recent victim of President-elect Donald Trumpâ€™s ire over the cost of its new 747 Air Force One jets, told FOXBusiness.com it looked forward to working with the President-elect after his victory last month, and would remain cooperative with his policies in the region.â€œShould the U.S. Government determine it is appropriate that the sanctions removed under the nuclear agreement â€˜snap backâ€™ into place, we would comply with that determination,â€ù the companyâ€™s vice president of communications, Gordon Johndroe, said.The political uncertainties regarding Trumpâ€™s policies toward Iran are profuse. The President-elect, who has called the deal â€œthe worst deal ever negotiatedâ€ù and has pledged to â€œdismantleâ€ù it, has sparked sharp criticism from Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in recent days.In an address at the University of Tehran, President Rouhani asked ""Do you think the United States can rip up the JCPOA (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal)? Do you think we and our nation will let him do that?""Tehran also reportedly held a vote on Sunday, to ban ""the purchase of U.S. consumer goods including animal and agricultural products"" in response to the unanimous Senate decision to renew the Iran Sanctions Act.â€œThe Iranians have no clue what to make of Trump. The uncertainty no doubt has them very nervous. And it has only gotten worse with the appointment of people like [General James] Mattis, [Rep. Mike] Pompeo and [General Mike] Flynn who are known to favor a much tougher approach toward Iran,â€ù Hannah said.Nevertheless, Shell, which has significant financial interests in the U.S., is no stranger to navigating the difficult relationship between Iran and the Western world. It was one of the first Western companies to reinvest in Iranâ€™s oil sector following its post-Islamic Revolution reopening in the 1990s, though that investment was ultimately cut short by the imposition of tighter financial sanctions.Royal Dutch Shell stock was trading slightly higher Wednesday afternoon."foxnews,Pop-Tarts is making two Dunkin Donuts coffee-infused flavors,"Cereal sales may be a bit soggy but Kellogg's has a new breakfast treat that may revive the morning meal.This week, the company announced two new varieties of coffee-flavored Pop-Tarts.According to Mashable, the new toaster pastries, inspired by Dunkinâ€™ Donuts coffee, are available in Frosted Chocolate Mocha and Frosted Vanilla Latte.

But the moment did not mark Mars' closest approach to Earth.This Monday evening (May 30) at 5:35 p.m. ET, Mars will be the closest it has been to Earth since Oct. 5, 2005: 0.50321377 astronomical units (AU), or 46,762,695 miles . (One AU is the average distance from Earth to the sun â€” about 93 million miles.)Opposition and closest Earth approach occur on different days because the orbit of Mars is elliptical. When opposition occurred May 22, Mars was still approaching Earth on its orbital track, and will not reach minimum distance to Earth until May 30. After 5:35 p.m. ET on that date, Mars will begin to recede from Earth. [Video - Skywatching Mars: 2016 Is A Great Time!]The graphic shows how Mars would appear viewed with a superb telescope at the exact instant of closest approach. The landing site of NASA's Opportunity rover is just rotating out of sight on the Red Planet's eastern limb, and the solar system's highest volcano, Olympus Mons, is just coming into view on the western limb. Mars' Valles Marineris, far larger and deeper than Earth's Grand Canyon, is close to the center of the disk, and the dusky Acidalia Planitia is high to the north, close to the small north polar cap.What can you see with an ordinary amateur telescope? Very little, I'm afraid. You might see a hint of the polar cap, and a few dusky shadings. Astronomers studying Mars from Earth use a slightly different terminology. Acidalia Planitia is known as the Mare Acidalium, the dark area to the southeast of the Valles Marineris as the Mare Erythraeum, and the dark area just south of Marineris is called Solis Lacus. These older names are, like the ""seas"" and ""lakes"" on the moon, imaginary bodies of water on a dry world.When lighting conditions are exactly right, Olympus Mons can be spotted by keen-eyed observers on Earth, but the mighty Valles Marineris has never been seen from here (although the huge canyon complex has been mapped in detail by satellites in orbit around Mars).Regular observers of Mars soon become familiar with the normal patterns of light and dark on its surface, known as ""albedo markings."" If you observe Mars over a few hours, you will see these markings appear to move slowly across the disk, as Mars rotates just slightly more slowly than Earth, a full rotation taking 24 hours, 37 minutes and 23 seconds. Because of Mars' slightly longer day, if you observe Mars at the same time on successive nights, the markings will seem to move.Sometimes the albedo markings seem to change shape. Usually this is caused by gigantic dust storms sweeping across the face of Mars. Recently, British amateur astronomer Damian Peach reprocessed a number of old images made of Mars in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, using modern image-processing techniques. Peach's work revealed amazing detail not visible in the original images, and some of this detail has shown clear changes from back then to modern times. It is thought that these changes result from the shifting sands of Mars over the decades.Nowadays, most of the serious amateur studies of Mars are made through imaging, with multiple images being combined by ""stacking"" to bring out the finest detail. These images rival or exceed the finest professional images of only a few years ago. However, there still are ""old school"" amateurs like myself sketching Mars using centuries-old techniques.Editor's note: If you snap an amazing photo of Mars and would like to share it with Space.com and our news partners for a possible story or image gallery, send images and comments to managing editor Tariq Malik at spacephotos@space.com."foxnews,Shepard Smith Salutes His Father and the Greatest Generation in Touching Tribute,"This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

""It's not on a real foundation and it's slowly tilting and leaning and listing. And we just, we really wanted to preserve the cabin.""ZION NATIONAL PARK MAY START LIMITING TOURISTSThe state is also working to build a parking lot big enough for 20 cars and four buses.""We took some counts,"" Bushman said. ""We were getting between 60 and 90 cars a day stopping here, out on the highway.""The cabin is currently owned by Afton Morgan, but many believe it is where Cassidy grew up. Cassidy, whose real name was Robert Leroy Parker, was born in Beaver in 1866 and the Parker family did live in the Circleville cabin. It is unknown if Cassidy lived there with his family of if he had already left to live the life of an outlaw.""There's a lot of rumors of that,"" Morgan said.

The military shared the photo with wildlife officials including Game and Fish and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.Mark Hart, a spokesman for the Arizona Game and Fish Department, said jaguars migrate from Mexico to southern Arizona about every five to 10 years but that a female jaguar hasn't been spotted in the U.S. since the 1940s.""So the quality of life isn't here for the jaguar,"" Hart said.But Arizona, New Mexico and other parts of the Southwest were home to jaguars before habitat loss and predator control programs aimed at protecting livestock eliminated them over the last 150 years. A hunter shot and killed the last verified female jaguar in the U.S. in 1963 in northern Arizona.""It's so exciting that in the last 30 years or so, five or six males have shown up in the U.S. and are starting to re-establish themselves in the historical range,"" said Rob Peters, a biologist with Defenders of Wildlife who is based in Tucson. Peters says that although there haven't been any female jaguars here, the fact that males are establishing habitats is a good sign that they could come in the future.It could be days before experts determine whether the jaguar seen in a Dec. 1 photo is new.Hart says analysts will study the jaguar's rosettes, or the spots within the spots on the cat's fur, to figure out if it's been seen before.Peters says his organization is anxiously awaiting a report by the federal government that is expected to outline a jaguar recovery plan for the area.""They were once found in Arizona as far north as the Grand Canyon. There were females and cubs in the Southwest,"" Peters said.But protecting the big cats has been fraught with legal challenges.In March 2014, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service set aside nearly 1,200 square miles along the U.S.-Mexico border as habitat essential for the conservation of the jaguar. The New Mexico Farm and Livestock Bureau, New Mexico Cattle Growers' Association and New Mexico Federal Lands Council filed a lawsuit nearly a year later, saying the decision was ""unlawful, arbitrary and capricious"" action by federal authorities. That lawsuit is ongoing.Only El Jefe has made numerous appearances in the U.S. in several years. He first popped up in the Whetstone Mountains in 2011 when he was about 3 years old and showed up again in video in the Santa Rita Mountains south of Tucson around September 2015."foxnews,"The land of milk, honey and spirits: Inside Israelâ€™s first whiskey distillery","Behind a small door in the heart of an industrial area of Tel Aviv, not far from the old port of Jaffa, resides the first whiskey distillery in Israel.The Milk and Honey, a name right out of the Book of Exodus, started out as a dream by six high-tech entrepreneurs who wanted to create something for themselves and their friends.â€œWe started out making beer in our living room, as a hobby,â€ù said Gal Kalkshtein. â€œAnd then one night, one of us said maybe we should try whiskey.

A surprisingly broad array of lawmakers, from both sides of the political aisle, immediately voiced concerns. Among the concerned parties? The Senate Judiciary Committee, which today held a hearing examining the impact on competition, and potential antitrust concerns, the merger could raise.As you would expect, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson thinks that letting his company snap up Time Warner will be great for everyone, especially AT&T. In his prepared testimony [PDF], Stephenson said that together, the two companies â€œwill disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models,â€ù give consumers more options, increase competition for cable TV providers, and, somehow, speed up the development and deployment of 5G wireless networks.Disruption in the pay-TV industry is, of course, already happeningâ€”and AT&T is already a participant. Not only is premium content now available online through services like HBO Now and Netflix, but also with the rise of streaming bundles like DirecTV Now, Dishâ€™s Sling TV, PlayStation Vue, and upcoming offerings from Hulu, â€œcableâ€ù has indeed begun to break open.â€œThese changes to the old TV model unquestionably have been good for consumers,â€ù Stephenson asserts. â€œBut consumers want and deserve more options and better choices.â€ùRelated Stories From Consumer ReportsSo how does the merger make that happen, exactly? The same way these things always do, in the end: money. Stephenson wants AT&T to own more content because then they donâ€™t have to pay third parties to get it on their own streaming service, DirecTV Now.Because while the method of deliveryâ€”streaming vs coaxial cableâ€”might be new, some things havenâ€™t changed: the content companies that own media still want the distribution companies to pay them for access to those networks and that content.Stephenson doesnâ€™t just hint at that reasoning; he states it outright. â€œCurrently, our ability to bring customers more of what they want has been constrained because we own very little of our own programming,â€ù Stephenson writes. â€œInstead, we have to negotiate [distribution] matters with third-party content owners, and in a fast-changing marketplace like video, it is particularly difficult to obtain flexibility . . . This transaction will help us break out of that box and reshape the competitive landscape.â€ùHe continues by describing how owning content will let AT&T optimize it and deliver it more readily on a variety of platforms, including mobile, because the company wouldnâ€™t have to seek rights agreements. â€œWe will be able to innovate more quickly, experiment more readily, tweak our offerings as we gauge customer response, and bring consumers the options they seek,â€ù Stephenson says. â€œWe want to give customers more control of how they watch their video content . . . we are in an ideal position to do that because of our own mobile network . . . we expect to deliver mobile-optimized content and services, and ad-supported services that shift more costs from consumers to advertisers.â€ùIf Stephensonâ€™s comments are to be taken at face value, then what he alludes to throughout is not just the desirability but the necessity of vertical integration going forward in the 21st century. Acquiring content costs money; thus, owning content allows you to streamline deals and save money. And when you own that content, you can arrange to give it preferential treatment. Making your internet traffic travel faster, or slowing down a competitorsâ€™s, is now against the law thanks to the Open Internet Order of 2015 (aka, net neutrality), but exempting your own traffic from data caps you imposeâ€”zero-ratingâ€”is still something you can get away with, even if the FCC does have â€œconcernsâ€ù that it may harm consumers.Despite that leverage, however, Stephenson says that â€œit would be a gross mistake to view this transaction as anything but pro-competitive. This transaction is a vertical deal between two firms operating in separate marketsâ€”one in content distribution, the other in content production . . . AT&Tâ€™s and Time Warnerâ€™s businesses complement each other, and those complementary businesses, when combined, naturally result in consumer and competitive benefits.â€ùOpponents and critics, however, see anything but â€œnaturalâ€ù benefits for consumers.Our colleagues down the hall at Consumers Union (the policy and mobilization arm of our parent company, Consumer Reports), also submitted testimony to the committee [PDF], which Sen. Amy Klobuchar (MN) added to the record.In their testimony, Consumers Union points out that consumers benefit most from competitionâ€”and that mergers are, well, the opposite of that.â€œOne key to empowering consumers to protect themselves is working to ensure meaningful consumer choice, through effective competition,â€ù Consumers Union writes. â€œWhen consumers have meaningful choice, businesses are stimulated to provide more affordability, better quality, and new innovative thinking. By effective competition, we mean a marketplace marked by a fair and level playing field, where companies earn consumers with better products, lower prices, and attractive offerings and can compete free of exclusive deals and other monopolistic and anti-competitive barriers.â€ùContinued media consolidation, CU continues, is basically the opposite of that, â€œdespite the claims to the contrary always put forward by the merging parties.â€ùFor one thing, mergers like thisâ€”as weâ€™ve seen in the five years since Comcast snapped up NBCUniversalâ€”donâ€™t actually result in lower prices, CU points out. Programming and distribution costs keep going up, across the board, no matter who buys whom.So whatâ€™s really up? CU posits that AT&T is seeking not only money, but relevance. â€œA likely reasonâ€ù for the merger, CU suggests, â€œis that AT&T, as one of the nationâ€™s largest providers of wireless, pay-TV, and broadband service, is trying to position itself not to be relegated to the simple function of a utility just providing the connection that other use to make money supplying program content to consumers.â€ùBecause if that were all, in a competitive marketplace, consumers could feel free to walk away and switch providersâ€”something cable consumers canâ€™t usually do, but wireless and satellite customers can.â€œIf we believe the conventional wisdom that â€˜content is king,'â€ù CU continues, â€œthen acquiring content created and owned by Time Warner is AT&Tâ€™s gambit to prevent itself from being commoditized into, and to enable it to evolve into something more than a mere telecommunications company.â€ùAnd by becoming a content company, the testimony adds, AT&T â€œcould seek to maximize the value of this premium content [that Time Warner owns] in ways that could hurt consumers and competition.â€ùStephenson claims that withholding Time Warner content from competitors would make no sense, since the idea behind programming is to get it in front of as many eyes as possible. And to a point thereâ€™s something there, CU agrees, but in business, well, business tends to reign paramount. â€œAT&T might decide not to restrict content when negotiating with other large MVPDs [pay-TV companies, traditional or streaming] who also own contentâ€”and therefore, have their own leverageâ€”like Comcast-NBCU. But what about a small rural cable operator who does not own content, and possesses such a small subscriber base as to be at the mercy of whatever price AT&T decides to insist on for HBO or CNN?â€ùAnd of course, CU continues, there is the problem of zero-rating. â€œUnder [AT&Tâ€™s] â€˜Sponsored Dataâ€™ plan,â€ù CU writes, â€œDirecTV pays AT&T Mobility for zero-rated data service and other, unaffiliated video providers, such as Netflix or Charter, are reportedly able to obtain the service at the same rate. But because the payment from DirecTV to AT&T Mobility is AT&T simply moving money from one of its pockets to another, there is potential for anti-competitive cross-subsidizationâ€”the same payment does not â€˜costâ€™ them as much as it costs the independents.â€ùThatâ€™s how preferential treatment benefits companies: someone concerned about potentially incurring high fees for going over their mobile data limit is going to be more likely to gravitate to a service that doesnâ€™t count against that limit. That means other companiesâ€”say something like Sling TV, theoreticallyâ€”would either have to pay AT&T for access to zero-rate their customers, or AT&T customers would instead potentially avoid it in favor of something that spares them data costs. Either way, AT&T wins.â€œWe view the choice between these two outcomes as a â€˜double whammyâ€™ that hurts competition in the emerging market of streaming, over-the-top wireless video,â€ù CU concludes.AT&T is, of course, not alone here, as CU notes. Comcast/NBCU is the biggest merger of media and content companies in recent years, but itâ€™s not the only one. Verizon, too, has been trying to move into content, with extremely limited success. Still, its acquisition of AOL and pending attempt to buy Yahoo are both with an eye to expanding its advertising and media presence.Copyright Â© 2005-2016 Consumers Union of U.S., Inc.

Those schools would then be required to post the kitchen grade in an area that is publicly visible to kids and any visiting parents.NEARLY 30 PERCENT OF LOS ANGELES FOOD TRUCKS FACE SANITATION PROBLEMS, REPORT FINDSThe legislative push comes after new City Health Department records, obtained by the IDC, showed unsanitary conditions at 13 percent of school cafeterias surveyed. In the last fiscal year, 395 out of 2,976 completed inspections resulted in a sanitation grade of B or worse, the New York Daily News reported.Out of those reviewed, 320 cafeterias had 442 mouse-related health violations, 136 schools had 155 fly-related violations and, in four schools, evidence of rats was discovered.School cafeterias in Brooklyn were the most affected and they also led in the amount of violations for mice, flies, roaches and pests.â€œMany young people have their basic meals at the school cafeteria ... and I think itâ€™s extremely important we know how clean or how dirty those cafeterias are,â€ù State Senator Jeff Klein, who heads the IDC, said amid the report's release.â€œWe expect our kids to get Aâ€™s and we should expect the cafeterias that feed them to work just as hard to make the grade,â€ù an IDC report said. â€œIt begs the question why the city is more transparent about the performance of private restaurants than with its own performance in keeping those kitchens we utilize to feed students clean.â€ùCHIPOTLE'S STRUGGLES CONTINUE AS COMPETITORS MOVE INBut there's good news for the majority of kids who eat meals at school cafeterias. If graded, 86 percent of cafeterias in the study would have received an A under the standards the Health Department applies to restaurants currently.Health Department officials say they are are reviewing the proposed legislation and hope to to ""work closely together [with the Department of Education] to correct violations quickly."""foxnews,Caught on video: Wildebeest 'revives' dying friend,"This isnâ€™t something you normally see in the wild.A tourist captured on video a wildebeest helping bring its dying friend back to life as it lay on the side of a road in South Africa.NEW SPIDER SPECIES DISCOVERED IN INDIANABradley Ballantyne, 46, told LatestSightings.com that he saw the scene unfold in Martloth Park, just outside of Kruger National Park, one of the countryâ€™s most popular wildlife viewing spots.

And a new scientific study says the state is on its way back to calmer times that prevailed before a huge jump in man-made quakes.For quake-prone parts of Oklahoma, the state ordered what is essentially a 40 percent reduction in injection of the saltwater that scientists generally blame for the massive increase in earthquakes. This year, before the new rules went into effect on May 28, Oklahoma averaged 2.3 quakes a day. Since then the average dropped to 1.3 a day, based on AP's analysis of U.S. Geological Survey data of earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or larger. But some of those fewer post-regulatory quakes have been large and damaging.""Definitely the rate of quakes have gone down,"" said USGS geophysicist Robert Williams. ""At the same time we had more magnitude 5s this year than ever before historically in Oklahoma. It's good news on one hand. It's heading in the right direction, but troubling to see these large damaging quakes in Pawnee and Cushing.""Over the last couple years, scientists have linked a dramatic increase in earthquakes in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas to the practice of injecting wastewater from hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, back underground after drilling for oil and gas. Higher volumes of wastewater injected are connected to more quakes with the fluids adding more pressure to tiny faults. After Kansas regulated wastewater volume in March 2015, a January AP analysis showed that Kansas felt fewer quakes, while less-regulated Oklahoma got more. In response, Oklahoma announced new regulations.This November, Oklahoma had an average of less than a quake per day, though a 5.0 magnitude quake shook the vulnerable Cushing area where massive oil reserves are stored.""The trend is obvious,"" said Stanford University professor William Ellsworth. He said the AP numbers were similar, but not identical to a trend he calculated using a different database and different size earthquakes. He said the new regulations were partly responsible for the falloff in earthquakes, but he noted there also has been less drilling because of a crash in oil prices.Williams of USGS said it is important to put even the reduced one-a-day quakes in context. Before 2009, Oklahoma averaged one magnitude 3.0 earthquake a year; now it is good news that the rate is down to one a day, he said. In 2015, Oklahoma averaged 2.3 magnitude 3.0 or larger quakes a day. In 2014, it was 1.6 per day.A study published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances by a different Stanford seismologist, Mark Zoback, saw the reduction in Oklahoma quakes and used intricate computer simulations to show that the rate of earthquakes will continue to go down and eventually return to near pre-2009 levels. Williams and Ellsworth, who weren't part of the study, said Zoback's work made sense.""We're not out of the woods yet. There is still a possibility for potentially damaging earthquakes,"" Zoback said. ""It's going to take a few years for the situation to return to normal.""Oklahoma officials said they plan to continue the regulations and are expected to release a new directive in the next couple of weeks for the 15,000-square-mile area where strong quakes rattled Pawnee and Cushing.""Obviously the goal is to bring seismicity down to what, for Oklahoma, would be considered a normal level. That's the goal,"" said Matt Skinner, a spokesman for the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, the agency that oversees oil and gas operations. ""Things will take time, but we're going to move ahead with actions that will hopefully make that time sooner rather than later.""Oklahoma has had three quakes magnitude 5.0 or larger since 2014, and two of them occurred after the May regulations took effect: The September 5.8 in Pawnee and the November quake in Cushing.Pent-up pressure may be partly to blame, Zoback said. And Williams noted some injecting continues.Mainly, though, ""we don't understand the plumbing down there,"" Williams said."foxnews,New app hopes to become the Tinder of air travel,foxnews,'On the Record' signs off for the final time,foxnews,Michael Goodwin: Trump says 'thank you' to everyday Americans while Clinton parties with the plutocrats,"The New York Post report that Hillary Clinton is throwing a party to thank big donors presents a nice contrast with Donald Trump.Heâ€™s holding huge rallies around the nation to say thank you to tens of thousands of everyday Americans, while Hillary huddles with a few plutocrats in Manhattan.By the way, reports say she spent about $1 billion to lose, perhaps 10 times what Trump spent.

The iconic American brand has announced it will be donating the doors from Sam Waltonâ€™s first Arkansas outpost to Smithsonianâ€™s National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.Sam Walton opened his first Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Ark. in 1945. After being in business for five years, Walton had to relocate when his landlord refused to renew his lease. According to the Walmart Museum, Walton relocated the store to Bentonville, and within the first year he was commanding impressive six-figure sales.Related Image Expand / Contract The original Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Ark. in 1945. (Photo courtesy of The Walmart Museum)After the Arkansas store proved successful, Bud Walton, Samâ€™s brother, opened a second outpost in Ruskin Heights, Mo., a Kansas City suburb. In 1962, Sam Walton opened his first eponymous Wal-Mart after successfully managing nine Ben Franklin stores. At the time, offering low priced goods in rural communities was the main company focus.Today, Walmart operates over 11,000 stores in 28 countries, under 60 different brands names.SURPRISING FACTS ABOUT WALMART FOODYet despite its major global presence today , artificats from the early days of Walmart are few and far between, says Alan Dranow, the director of the Walmart Museum.â€œWe had absolutely no artifacts, nothing from that store because nobody held onto them,â€ù Dranow told FoxNews.com. â€œNobody knew that Walmart was going to be what Walmart became or that Sam was going to become what he became.â€ùEnter the doors from the very first Ben Franklin store.Related Image Expand / Contract Photo courtesy of The Walmart Museum (Visitors take in an exhibit at the Walmart Museum in Bentonville, Ark. )According to Dranow, the doors were kept for decades in a warehouse by Gene Ivy, co-owner of the Arkansas-based contractor Ivy Brothers Construction. The company was charged with renovating Waltonâ€™s first store in Newport in the 1960s-- and the original doors have been kept in storage since then.Ivy kept the doors in his garage after he retired. When he died in 2014, one of his grandchildren contacted a Walmart employee about what to do with salvaged store relics. The Walmart Museum, which first opened in 1990 as the Walmart Visitor Center, was more than happy to take in the prized store relics this summer.But Dranow admits the doors have seen their share of wear and tear.""Because Waltonâ€™s store was so popular he had more traffic than anybody.

In an alert sent to doctors, the cityâ€™s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene urged vigilance and continued to discourage women from traveling to areas battling the virus, The New York Times reported.According to Wednesdayâ€™s alert, since July, at least four babies have been born in New York City with Zika-related symptoms, which can include microcephaly, in which the childâ€™s brain is severely underdeveloped. The Department of Health reported the first case of a baby born in New York City with microcephaly on July 22.The New York Times reported that, as of Dec. 2, 962 city residents tested positive for Zika, including 325 pregnant women.â€œTodayâ€™s news is a reminder that Zika continues to be a threat to pregnant women and their babies,â€ù said the cityâ€™s health commissioner, Dr. Mary T. Bassett, according to The New York Times.â€œWe are closely following all babies born to mothers who test positive for Zika infection and will connect parents to available services to improve their childâ€™s quality of life,â€ù she added.Pregnant women and women trying to become pregnant should avoid travel to parts of Central and South America, Mexico, the Caribbean, according to the New York Department of Health.A report published in November found that Zika infection, which is spread by infected mosquitos, can cause a range of damaging symptoms, including a collapsed skull, eye scarring, severe muscle tension and brain calcifications.The Zika virus set off worldwide concern after an outbreak in Brazil, where babies are now turning one and families continue to struggle with medical problems."foxnews,Bizarre Oreos,"After turning red velvet cake, cinnamon buns and a host of other desserts into Oreo form, Nabisco is rolling out two limited edition fruit flavors for summer 2016.The blueberry pie flavor, available exclusively at Target, is made with graham-flavored cookies and a light purple blueberry crÃ¨me filling.

Since being elected president, Trump hasnâ€™t voiced an opinion on the merger.â€œI hear AT&T and Time Warner have hired most of the meaningful lobbyists in Washington to get this deal done,â€ù Ruddy told FOX Business. â€œBut I know Trump has concerns and many in Congress will agree that AT&T has too much power to decide what content Americans can watch.â€ùPart of the allure of the deal, of course, is the marriage of AT&Tâ€™s cable and wireless distribution services with content supplied by Time Warner, which owns cable news network CNN and HBO.Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENTBut Ruddy said given AT&Tâ€™s size and scope, it has the ability to squeeze out competing voices in favor of what he considers the liberalism of CNN, which will ultimately hurt consumers.He pointed to his own negotiations with AT&T involving getting Newsmax television on AT&Tâ€™s DirectTV satellite distribution system. Ruddy said talks between the two sides to have Newsmax get back on the system recently became strained after AT&T announced the Time Warner deal in October.A spokesman for AT&T didnâ€™t return a call for comment.On Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committeeâ€™s Subcommittee on Antitrust held a hearing on the proposed deal. The committee oversees various federal agencies such as the Federal Communications Committee and the Justice Departmentâ€™s antitrust division, which will render a verdict on the transaction.Lawmakers at times appeared skeptical about the dealâ€™s merits; some appeared to see justification in the notion that the combination will give AT&T too much power as a monopoly to set higher prices for consumers and possibly limit the distribution of content to favor Time Warnerâ€™s programming.That said, it was unclear whether lawmakers or even Trump, now that heâ€™s been elected president, will expend political capital to kill the merger. At least one witness during the hearing, internet entrepreneur Mark Cuban, said cable companies like AT&T no longer have a monopoly on the distribution of information since consumers get so much of their content on websites like Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOGL).But Ruddy believes he and his team will have Trumpâ€™s ear on the issue. The two met during Thanksgiving at Trumpâ€™s Mar-a-Lago Palm Beach estate as part of an informal gathering of people.Ruddy says he will discuss the matter with Trump at some point soon and he will continue to press key lawmakers on the Judiciary Committee to kill the deal.A spokeswoman for Trump didnâ€™t return calls for comment."foxnews,"I'm a Democrat but I've gotta admit it's now Trump 2, Dems 0","Following President-elect Trump's surprise phone call on Friday with the Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, the response has been predictable if not disheartening. Academics in D.C. this morning are claiming that, â€œTrumpâ€_doesnâ€™t have clue.â€ù An expert at the University of California added that the call was â€œimpulsive.â€ùRegrettably, my Democratic Party pushed back too. By its measure, Trump demonstrated his â€œincompetenceâ€ù and threatened our national security. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) went so far as to say that Trumpâ€™s actions might push the nation into war with China.What academics and my party donâ€™t understand is that heâ€™s not interested in starting a war. He simply recognizes that weâ€™re already in one. And heâ€™s giving voice to its long-suffering victims: millions of voters in places like North Carolina, Ohio, and Michigan.To understand the battlefield, readers should travel to North Carolina and talk to the former workers at Alpha Aluminum. For decades, these swing-state voters produced foil for eventual use in cigarette packages. This past summer, however, over 100 American workers lost their jobs. The reason? Cheap Chinese aluminum imports.The result? Carolinians are scrambling to feed their families while workers in faraway Zhenjiang collect what used to be an American paycheck.The story of Alpha is the story of U.S. manufacturing for the past three decades. Economists in liberal enclaves pushed for â€œglobalization,â€ù arguing that cheap goods made abroad would fatten the pocketbooks of all us back here in the United States. Despite pleas from unions, our elected leaders happily agreed. Both Republicans and Democrats signed up for NAFTA and, later, Chinaâ€™s entry into the World Trade Organization.But all did not go well. From steel plants in Ohio to furniture factories in North Carolina, American companies suddenly found themselves competing against Chinese labor that paid a few pennies to each of Joe Six Packâ€™s dollars. You donâ€™t need a PhD in Keynesian economics to predict the result: U.S. companies shut down, or moved operations abroad.To be sure, Americans have gotten a lot of cheap goods in return for this deal. But thereâ€™s a catch: millions of voters no longer have the jobs â€“ or a livable income â€“ to afford them. Initially, economists believed that this would be a temporary condition. Surely, they argued, these unemployed workers would find new jobs that paid just as good as the old.Last summer, however, academics released a study that took 38 pages to acknowledge the obvious: they were wrong. It turns out that our political class had sold off the American dream to the Chinese and given blue-collar workers â€“ and their communities â€“ an economic nightmare in its place.But it gets worse. Thatâ€™s because China hasnâ€™t been content to just take American jobs through unfair competition. Theyâ€™re stealing them via cyber-warfare too.Consider the case of U.S. Steel. In 2011, the Chinese government hacked its way into U.S. Steelâ€™s computer systems and stole trade secrets. They passed the information to an assortment of Chinese steel companies, allowing these competitors to produce advanced steel products. As a consequence, we lost market share, and jobs.Or consider the case of American Superconductor, which produces advanced software for wind turbines. In 2011, the company discovered that the Chinese Government had stolen its source code, giving it to their own corporation Sinovel. The result? Over 600 American workers lost their jobs and the company took a $1 billion hit in shareholder value. Adding insult to injury, Chinaâ€™s Sinovel later sold its wind turbines to the State of Massachusetts, paid for with taxpayer dollars.The Chinese goal in all of this is clear: grow their economy through theft, and at the expense of American innovation.Smart Democrats know this. And, indeed, President Obama made a series of threats to the Chinese demanding that they stop. But, according to my former colleagues in the intelligence community, the hacking continues.Enter President-elect Trump and his â€œundiplomaticâ€ù phone call.Only Mr. Trump knows why he accepted the call from Chinaâ€™s nemesis, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen. But Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway has made it clear that the President-elect was fully aware of the callâ€™s implications. And reporting from Trump insiders suggests that the phone call was part of a long-planned chess move to warn Beijing that our relationship was about to change.Politically, Trump has now beaten Democrats twice in one week. His efforts in Indiana to save jobs at Carrier made him look tough and focused on the American worker. And now heâ€™s pushing back against the greatest job killer of all: Communist China.So rather than bash Trump reflexively, I beg my party to be smarter. Stop broadcasting knee-jerk press releases over phone calls, especially when theyâ€™re designed to punish a thief. Instead, letâ€™s double down on Trumpâ€™s move.How? Debt forgiveness.China owns $1.3 trillion of U.S. debt, which is a massive burden that could otherwise go to the rebuilding of our inner cities and crumbling infrastructure. A savvy Democratic Party could suggest that Trump renegotiate that debt, deducting the total cost of what theyâ€™ve stolen from American industry â€“ and American workers. Costs of cyber warfare on the U.S. economy are calculated at some $250 billion a year. Trump should work with the CIA, NSA, and Departments of State and Treasury to tally Chinaâ€™s responsibility from that amount and make them pay through bare-knuckle negotiations.Make no mistake, Democrats cannot simply be an echo chamber for the President-elect as he tackles tough issues abroad. The country needs a faithful opposition to hold him accountable, especially when it comes to conflicts of interest related to his many foreign resorts and buildings. To the point, there are troubling reports that heâ€™s considering a hotel deal in Taiwanâ€™s capital Taipei.Still, we have to be smarter than simply being the Party of No, especially when it comes to taking on China. Not only is it a political loser, weâ€™ll be viewed as cowardly. Beijing has gotten away with economic murder for far too long. Itâ€™s time we fought back.Bryan Dean Wright is a former CIA ops officer and member of the Democratic Party. He contributes on issues of politics, national security, and the economy.

On the West Coast, the naÃ¯ve complacency that â€œit canâ€™t happen hereâ€ù abruptly rotated to the frenzied fear that â€œit can happen here, and it can happen at any moment!â€ùIn his new book, ""Panic on the Pacific: How America Prepared for a West Coast Invasion,"" noted historian and author Bill Yenne returns to the dark and fearful early months of World War II to examine the reaction of the people, the politicians, and the military to what was genuinely perceived as an immediate threat of a full-scale Japanese invasion. Here are seven things that you may not know happened on the West Coast after the Pearl Harbor attacks.1. On December 7, the Japanese almost burned down their consulate in San Francisco.At the Japanese Consulate on Jackson Street, Consul General Yoshio Muto and his secretary, Kazuyoshi Inagaki, were taken by surprise with the news that Pearl Harbor had been attackedâ€” just like everyone else in the city.Their reaction was to get rid of all their sensitive files. They became so consumed with shoveling paperwork into the big fireplace, that the flames got out of control and almost consumed the sprawling mansion. The fire department had to be called.2. General John DeWitt, the West Coast Army commander, grew so paranoid that he cancelled the Rose Bowl.Being deathly afraid of a Japanese attack on the West Coast at any moment, the commander of the US Armyâ€™s Western Defense Command banned large gatherings. Among other things, DeWitt ordered that the Rose Bowl, which was always played in Pasadena, California on New Yearâ€™s Day, be cancelled.Duke University generously offered to host the game at its stadium in Durham, North Carolina. Favored by 14, the Duke Blue Devils lost a close 20-16 game to Oregon State. It was the Beaversâ€™ only Rose Bowl victory ever.3. The U.S. military had to borrow machine guns from Hollywood.On the afternoon of December 7, Fritz Dickie at Stembridge Gun Rentals in Hollywood received a phone call from the U.S. Coast Guard. Stembridge operated what was known in the trade as the â€œGun Roomâ€ù on the Paramount Pictures lot. Founded in 1920 to supply firearms to the film industry, the facility was one of the biggest private arsenals anywhere. The Coast Guard needed guns â€” especially Thompson Submachine Guns. â€œWe loaded them on trucks and, by night, the guns which had been used mostly in gangster pictures were ready for the feared Japanese invasion,â€ù Dickie recalled.4. Japanese Navy submarines did prowl the West Coast.Beginning shortly after Pearl Harbor, a flotilla of Japanese submarines attacked shipping up and down the West Coast in a reign of terror that lasted until Christmas Eve. In one instance, people on the Pacific Coast Highway in California watched the submarine I-21 attack and sink the Union Oil Company tanker SS Montebello just a short distance offshore. â€œShe upended like a giant telephone pole and slowly settled into the sea,â€ù wrote a newspaper editor who witnessed the attack.5. The West Coast actually was bombed by Japanese aircraft.The Japanese air attack feared and predicted by General DeWitt and others immediately after Pearl Harbor actually did materializeâ€” though not for ten months. In September 1942, Warrant Officer Nobuo Fujita flew two bombing missions over southwestern Oregon in a seaplane that was carried in a water tight hangar on the deck of the submarine I-25. The object was to use incendiary bombs to start forest fires. It had been a damp summer that year and the fires did not spread6. One Japanese Attack on the West Coast was a grudge match.In addition to their attacks on merchant ships, the Japanese submarines shelled the coast three times, including strikes against Estevan Point in British Columbia and Fort Stevens in Oregon.The first attack came on the evening of February 23, 1942, when Commander Kozo Nishino brought the I-17 from beneath the waves and ordered his deck gunners to begin lobbing shells at the Ellwood oil fields north of Santa Barbara, California. For Nishino, this was no random target. Before the war, he had been the captain of an oil tanker that came to load crude oil here. As he was coming ashore, he slipped and fell into a cactus. Workers on a nearby oil rig laughed at the sight of him plucking cactus spines from his posterior. Nishino swore to get even.7. The Battle of Los Angeles, called a false alarm at the time, still raises questions.On the night of February 24, 1942, after weeks of rumors of Japanese aircraft operating with impunity over the West Coast, reports deemed credible led air defense officials to order an alert.As searchlights stabbed the night sky over Southern California, hundreds of people reported seeing unidentified aircraft in the sky. Long Beach Police Chief Joseph McClelland watched nine. At the Inglewood City Hall, policemen saw over 150. Anti-iaircraft guns responded with 1,440 large shells and countless .50-caliber rounds. Because of this, no American interceptors took off to join the fray.There were dozens of reports of a large, round, slow-moving object in the sky. Some thought it to be a balloon, while others insisted it was definitely not.Future UFO enthusiasts would, and still do, focus a great deal of attention on this aspect of the nightâ€™s excitement.The next day in Washington, Secretary of War Henry Stimson confirmed that there â€œprobablyâ€ù were enemy aircraft. U.S. Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall said that â€œas many as 15 planes may have been involved.â€ù However, Navy Secretary Frank Knox announced that it was all a â€œfalse alarm.â€ù Because these conflicting initial assessments were never resolved, many people assumed that deliberate government obfuscation was in play.To this day, the Battle of Los Angeles â€œcoverâ€‘upâ€ù still draws its own cadre of true believers whenever conspiracy theorists congregate.Bill Yenne is the author of the recently released Panic on the Pacific, as well as more than three dozen other non fiction books, mainly on historical topics.

Consider eating these plants as part of a holiday celebration, as one may do in Japan, or eating them slow-cooked in a stew with pork and chiles, as is commonly done in Mexico. Weeds aren't factory-farmed; they're optimized to the conditions of wherever they happen to be growing; they are, by definition, a local food. Plusâ€”cheap as hell.Related Image Expand / Contract (iStock)Speaking of definitions: What do we mean when we talk about weeds? There are some characteristics that may attach to the conceptâ€”exuberant growth, a certain quality of nuisance. But according to the dictionary itself the (sort of sad) truth is this: A weed is a ""plant that is not valued where it is growing.""So there you have it. Weeds are not a class of vegetable. They're not an inherent threat to successful gardens, nor some broad category of indigestible plant. They're simply something that, according to the judgment of a broader cuisine or a culture, is unwanted.But what if that judgment is wrong?What makes wild plants nutritious is the same thing that has, historically in the U.S., made them undesirable. ""A lot of wild plants that aren't popular have bitter qualities that we've over time bred out of a lot of our plants,"" Kristen Rasmussen, a nutritionist, cook, forager, and co-investigator at the Berkeley Open Food Source (BOFS), told me.In fact, there's plenty of grocery-store fare that's less nutritious than its wild relatives, including fennel and lettuce. That's because wild greens tend to be specifically heavy in phytonutrients, a kind of antioxidant that's thought to help prevent cancer and cardiovascular disease. Wild dandelion, for instance, contains seven times more phytonutrients than spinach. Tests conducted by the BOFS found that wild dandelions also contain about twice as much fiber and iron, and more calcium, than their domesticated counterparts.""The bitter compounds [in weeds] can signal something that we're not supposed to eat,"" Rasmussen said. Aversion to bitterness has an evolutionary component, helping humans avoid toxic plants, like rhubarb leaves. But bitterness is a flavor imparted by many phytonutrients, which also contribute bitterness to chocolate, red wine, and green tea, the taste of which you don't tend to hear a lot of complaints about. It's possible we've overreacted, and farmers over generations have selected plants that are sweeter, milder, you could even say blanderâ€”and, accordingly, far less nutritious.In truth, in the U.S., wild greens never went away altogether, though they're rare at the supermarket. As Ronni Lundy writes in her forthcoming book, Victuals, a volume of Appalachian recipes and history, people in the mountains have long eaten wild greensâ€”pokeweed, dock, purslane, lamb's quarters, and upland cress, locally called creasy greens. When she was young, Lundy's parents moved out of Appalachia in search of jobs. ""When my parents lived in Detroit during World War II so my daddy could work in the factories, my mother gathered dandelion and other wild greens from the median of a boulevard,"" Lundy writes. ""She told me she couldn't find kale or mustard in the grocery, but the tender greens cooked with bacon provided a taste of home.""Outside of the states, weeds are even more embraced. In January in Japan, people celebrate the Festival of Seven Herbs by eating a porridge made with seven wild herbs of spring. And Mexican cuisine has a name for a whole class of wild greens called quelitesâ€”""basically an umbrella term for any type of green grown in Mexico that has small edible leaves,"" such as amaranth, malva, and epazote, said Lesley Tellez, the author of the cookbook Eat Mexico: Recipes From Mexico City's Streets, Markets and Fondas, and the proprietor of the blog The Mija Chronicles. On that blog, Tellez has written repeatedly about quelites, with recipes for guisado de queliteâ€”stewed greensâ€”and purslane in salsa verde.Though quelites have traditionally been thought of in Mexico more as peasant food, Tellez said, ""I think that perception is changing. More and more people are realizing that they're packed with nutrients, they're delicious, and they're relatively inexpensive."" She attributes the changing attitudes to an embrace of Mexican cooking. ""For a long time in Mexico it was considered more fashionable to look outward, and to look at European cuisines, and to look at the United States. In the past 20 to 30 years, there were chefs who really started to plant the seeds of looking inward, reexamining the cuisine, looking at the rich tradition that Mexican food really has, and for the first time saying, hey, this is awesome.""In the U.S. there is at least one foraged plant that garners attention: ramps, the wild-growing allium that, come spring, is the hottest wild food on the block. But the popularity of ramps isn't unproblematic. Overharvesting can damage the plant's long-term prospects and threaten the health of its surrounding habitat. In Quebec, as Epicurious explained last year, the commercial sale of ramps has been illegal since 1995, owing to concerns about overharvesting.It's not just ramps; other wild plants are at similar risk. In their 2012 cookbook Foraged Flavor, for instance, authors Tama Matsuoka Wong and Eddy Leroux organized wild plants into groups of green, yellow, and red, the first comprising species that should be picked with abandonedâ€”mostly invasive, aggressive plants like garlic mustard. Yellow denoted plants that should be harvested advisedly, like ramps, elderflower, and cattails; the authors say a good rule of thumb is to take only 20 percent of what you find. Red plants, such as anise hyssop, should be picked only from your garden.In California, the Berkeley Open Food Source is trying to spread the word on weedsâ€”specifically wild foods that are available in urban areas. In the Bay Area these include nasturtium leaves, wild mustard and radish, and nuts from the California bay laurel tree, which Kristen Rasmussen says taste like ""coffee and chocolate combined"" when they're toasted. (She provides further information, and suggestions for further use, on her website.)The organization has sponsored wild-food walks and wild-food weeks at local restaurants, and BOFS advocates for forager-friendly public policy, like reduced herbicide use. But the group is also thinking more creatively about what wild foods can do. For instance, trying to encourage farmers to sell weeds rather than discard them. And BOFS has mapped three areas in Berkeley, Oakland, and Richmond with limited access to groceries and fresh produce, and where wild foods might provide easily accessible, affordable nutrition.Part of the process involves soil testing to allay concerns over toxins. (And over other stuff: The first question in an FAQ on the organization's website is ""What about dog pee?"") And part of it is just about public educationâ€”teaching people to identify what's edible and what's not. This is probably easier in verdant Northern California than it might be in less temperate climes, but Rasmussen recommended getting a book or twoâ€”there's plenty out thereâ€”and asking around about local experts and foraging tours. ""There's a lot of cool social networking happening in the wild-food world,"" she said."foxnews,The â€˜Ghost Fleet of Mallows Bayâ€™ in pictures,"The â€˜Ghost Fleet of Mallows Bayâ€™ in picturesThe â€œGhost Fleet of Mallows Bayâ€ù in the Potomac River, which includes nearly 200 known vessels, has been nominated as a national marine sanctuary.

Well, most of the country. But not Democrats.Democrats are correct to be licking their wounds from Hillary Clintonâ€™s loss, looking around, and asking themselves â€œwhere is our future?â€ùSome Democrats argue that they should look to the mid-West where white working class voters turned against Democrat policies and chose Donald Trump. That would seem to make sense, considering those voters have voted Democrat for a very long time. Something went wrong with Democrat politics and they lost their own voters.What went wrong? Is it not obvious that the contemporary Democrat party abandoned the economic concerns of its voters and turned instead to identity politics? What is more important to Democrat leaders today? Paychecks or transgender bathrooms and showers? What is more important: jobs or white privelege?The answers have to be obvious, and you might think the Democrats would notice. Some probably have, but not all.Take todayâ€™s New York Times. Experienced and respected reporter Adam Nagourney writes that Democrats should look, not to Michigan or Pennsylvania, or Wisconsin where they needed to win and lost, but to â€_ wait for itâ€_California!Yes, California, the epicenter of identify politics. California, which gave Hillary Clinton virtually every one of the popular votes that for the basis for the left-wing argument that the Electoral College should be abolished. California, where politicians live on the tax base of tech and Hollywood billionaires. California, which used to lead the nation in trends, but which recently was slapped down and appears now to be out of step with the rest of the country.Nagourney touts for new Democrat leadership a perfect storm of racial/ethnic/gender rising stars: several young Latino leaders of the state legislature (count â€™em; there are so many), the young African-American-South-Asian former Attorney General who just won Barbara Boxerâ€™s Senate Seat (Black and Bollywood!), the lesbian term-limited member of the State Assembly who by merely announcing her candidacy for the State Senate caused the incumbent to step aside (the power of LGBTQ politics personified!).The state is a juggernaut of identity politics.California brags it is very successful. The legislature is sitting on a tech and entertainment economy so rich and cushy legislators have the leisure to busy themselves regulating cow flatulence.May I suggest this is not where the country is at.The country is not looking for even more arcane and out of touch regulations like new rules on cow farts. This is the crowd that thinks the tiny Delta Smelt is more important than an agriculture economy that was worth many many billions of dollars before farmers had to give up their water to save a two inch fish. Decisions like those are not what the rest of the country is yearning for. Just ask Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.The country is looking for politicians who know how to govern in a manner that encourages job creation and business expansion, not politicians who glide along on an entrepreneurial disruption economy â€“Silicon Valleyâ€“that is so supercharged it is impervious to their meddling and interference.California is an economic anomaly. An earthquake shack built to house San Francisco quake victims in 1906 can be had todayâ€“all 604 square feetâ€“for a mere $1.3 million (if you hurry and are prepared to offer above asking.) Where else can you find such a eye popping deal?It may be the kind of tech future the country aspires to, but it is not where the rest of the country is at right now. And voters elsewhere do not credit Californiaâ€™s politicians, no matter how young, no matter how non-white, no matter how gender fluid, with Californiaâ€™s economic success. Those golden state pols are much more likely to be seen as free-riders than the creators of the economic boon.So for the Democrats to turn to California for new leadership is great newsâ€_ for Republicans.Go ahead. Please. Advice like this is how Republicans are lined up to maintain a political and governing advantage, not lose it.I am a California native. If I had not moved out when I was fifty years old and experienced life in the rest of the country I might not have this perspective. But my eyes have been opened. Itâ€™s more than I can say for the state I left behind."foxnews,Denzel Washington Blasts Media for Selling 'BS',"By Judy Kurtz, The HillHe was at the center of a fake news story, but Denzel Washington says it's the mainstream media that's selling ""BS.""""If you don't read the newspaper, you're uninformed.

He suffered altitude sickness at the South Pole, 9,000 feet above sea level, and he needed to be evacuated to Christchurch, New Zealand.ASTRONAUT LEGEND BUZZ ALDRIN EVACUATED FROM SOUTH POLE TOURIST EXPEDITIONAldrin had been cleared by his doctors for the expedition, according to a statement from the outfitter White Desert Antarctica.â€œPeople donâ€™t realize when they travel overseas that medical care wonâ€™t always be comparable to the United States, whether in Mexico, parts of Europe, Africa or Asia,â€ù said Dr. William Brady, professor of emergency medicine at the University of Virginia and medical director at Allianz, an international travel insurance provider.Age is not necessarily a factor in travel-related illnesses like altitude sickness, and people donâ€™t get ill or injured only in remote locations, added Dr. Jan Stepanek, chairman of the Mayo Clinicâ€™s Division of Preventive Occupational & Aerospace Medicine and the High Altitude and Harsh Environments Medical Clinic in Arizona.He noted that people are often evacuated from the Grand Canyon due to excessive heat or dehydration.Think you're prepared? Travelers should always: --Know what insurance will cover in an emergency. Is the coverage sufficient for the location? Are pre-existing conditions covered? Travelers should always factor in that a medical emergency may occur away from home. --Educate themselves to symptoms they may experience wherever they are going. â€œYou wonâ€™t know you are in danger if you donâ€™t recognize the symptoms,â€ù says Dr. Jan Stepanek, chairman of the Mayo Clinicâ€™s Division of Preventive Occupational & Aerospace Medicine and the High Altitude and Harsh Environments Medical Clinic in Arizona. Dr. William Brady, professor of emergency medicine at the University of Virginia and medical director at Allianz, agrees. â€œIf you feel it is an emergency or donâ€™t know if it is, seek medical care immediately. Absolutely donâ€™t tough it out because you are on vacation.â€ù --Carry a recent medical record and list of medications on a flash drive or in a PDF on your phone, in case doctors need the information. --Bring extra medication in case you have to stay longer than planned. --Take a medical kit for less extreme cases. It should include bandages, antiseptic ointment or cream and over-the-counter medications for pain (acetaminophen, ibuprofen or naproxen), stomach upset (like Pepto-Bismol) and an antihistamine (like Benadryl.) Based on your health and where you are going, ask your physician or travel clinic what else you need.Travelers of all ages have had to be evacuated from vacation spots because of pneumonia, motor vehicle and scooter accidents, snake bites and even a barracuda attack, Brady said.Bob Mattson, a retired U.S. Navy chief petty officer who lives in Florida, had a heart attack in St. Maarten during a Caribbean cruise and had to be evacuated to Miami. At the urging of their travel agent, he and his wife, Diana, purchased travel insurance. It cost them $142 and it turned out to be â€œthe best deal on the planet,â€ù Diana Mattson said.Medical evacuation can cost $20,000 from a Caribbean cruise, and it can easily go into six figures from locations farther from the United States, said Daniel Durazo, a spokesman for Allianz, which insures 21 million customers and handles roughly 400 medical evacuations a year.Insurance covers the evacuation, coordination of care, transfers and other unforeseen expenses, such as when foreign hospitals ask patients to pay up front. Travel insurers guarantee payment, so travelers donâ€™t have to pay out of pocket.â€œIf we had not had the insurance, I do not know what we would have done,â€ù said Diana Mattson. â€œWho would we have called while we were sitting on that island? I would not have known which hospital to call to get a room and a doctor. I canâ€™t imagine the crushing cost if we had not had insurance.â€ùTravel insurance generally costs 5-10 percent of the cost of a non-refundable trip. (Travelers can compare plans at insuremytrip.com) Durazo said Allianzâ€™s most popular plan is the Classic, which provides $500,000 in emergency medical transportation coverage, enough to get you back from anywhere in the world.â€œI wouldn't have wanted to cover the five-figure cost of the medical evacuation from Panama,â€ù said travAlliancemedia executive editor Brian Major, who suffered a collapsed lung just as he arrived there last year. He was rushed to the emergency room straight from the airport and ultimately was evacuated, accompanied by medical personnel, on a Lear Jet to Miami, where he underwent surgery. Though he has traveled widely for his job for 30 years, including 10 times overseas each year, Major had purchased a travel insurance policy for the first time just before that trip.â€œI tell anyone who is traveling out of the country on any sort of leisure (or business) trip to purchase travel insurance,â€ù Major said.â€œI was really convinced by the EMS folks who transported me from Panama to Florida. After talking with them and realizing how often they evacuated folks out of unexpected situations, I realized it was pretty foolish to travel all these years without travel insurance.â€ùTravelers who are elderly or have chronic conditions should factor in the medical care that will be available when they choose a vacation, Brady said.But people who are heading to Antarctica â€” more than 43,000 are expected to visit this year, more than a third of them from the U.S., according to the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators â€” should note that Aldrinâ€™s situation was highly unusual.5 TIMES TRAVEL INSURANCE WON'T HELP A VACATION GONE WRONGThe South Pole is 9,000 feet above sea level and feels even higher, because the atmosphere is thinner at the Earthâ€™s poles, Stepanek said.Most people visit Antarctica by ship, so they remain at sea level. Abercrombie & Kent, which is known for its polar expeditions, has had only one situation in the last 15 years when the shipâ€™s onboard doctor required assistance, said company spokeswoman Pamela Lassers. That was for acute appendicitis.Aldrin, meanwhile, is recuperating and says he doesnâ€™t plan to let this slow him down. â€œIâ€™m looking forward to getting home soon to spend Christmas with my family,â€ù he said in a statement from his hospital bed. â€œYou ainâ€™t seen nothing yet!â€ùEileen Ogintz is the creator of the syndicated column and website Taking the Kids.

But the lawsuit argues that it didnâ€™t say what should happen if Loeb and Vergara were to split.Loeb, a 41-year-old businessman, spends his time between New York and Florida but has ties to Louisiana.He graduated from Tulane University and still serves as a reserve police officer in the state, according to sources.The then-happy couple first turned to in-vitro fertilization to have a child of their own in 2013.This article originally appeared in Page Six."foxnews,Report: Poor communication contributed to NYC airport panic,"Top security officials say poor communication contributed to a mass panic that erupted when loud cheers for Usain Bolt somehow led to a false report of gunshots at a New York City airport.Passengers in three terminals at Kennedy Airport ran for the exits on Aug. 14 after cheering at a terminal bar during the Olympics was mistaken for something sinister.

The act was first introduced by Congressman Bill Posey (R-FL) in June 2015.""Mr. Speaker, July 20, 2019 will mark the 50th anniversary of the landing of the 'Eagle' lunar module on the moon's surface,"" Posey, who was a member of the Apollo team in 1969, said on the House floor on Monday. "" We remain the only country that has ever launched humans [to] the moon and returned them safely to Earth.""This commemorative coin will celebrate what I feel is the most awe-inspiring engineering and technological [feat] of the 20th century,"" said Posey.Joining Posey as the initial cosponsors for the bill were representatives Frederica Wilson (D-FL), John Culberson (R-TX), Gene Green (D-TX) and Rod Blum (R-IA). The bill attracted the support of 293 more cosponsors before being passed on Monday.Should the bill pass in the Senate before the end of the year and the President sign it into law, then the U.S. Mint will be directed to strike convex coins bearing the iconic image reflected in Buzz Aldrin's helmet visor, as was taken by Neil Armstrong on the moon.""The design on the common reverse of the coins minted under this act shall be a representation of a close-up of the famous 'Buzz Aldrin on the moon' photo taken July 20, 1969, showing just the visor and [a] part of the helmet of astronaut [Aldrin], in which the visor reflects the image of the United States flag and the lunar lander,"" the legislation instructs.That design would be further highlighted by the shape of the commemoratives.""The coins minted under this act shall be produced in a fashion... so that the reverse of the coin is convex to more closely resemble the faceplate of the astronaut's helmet of the time,"" the bill directs.The act calls for the coins to be issued in four legal tender denominations:â€¢ $5 gold coins - not more than 50,000 pieces, with a diameter of 0.85 inches (2.16 centimeters);â€¢ $1 silver coins - not more than 400,000 pieces, with a diameter of 1.5 in. (3.8 cm);â€¢ Half-dollar clad coins - not more than 750,000, with a diameter of 1.25 in. (3.2 cm);â€¢ Proof-silver $1 coins - not more than 100,000, with a diameter of 3 inches (7.6 cm).Each of the coins, regardless of metal, will feature a front (obverse) design chosen by a juried competition overseen by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consulting with the Commission of Fine Arts and being viewed by the Citizen's Coinage Advisory Committee, which suggested the Apollo 11 theme in 2014.Proceeds from the Mint's sale of the Apollo 11 coins would benefit the Astronaut Memorial Foundation and Astronaut Scholarship Foundation's science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) programs, as well as the Smithsonian's ""Destination Moon"" gallery opening at the National Air and Space Museum in 2020.The coins' sale would also offset the cost of their minting, such that they are produced at no cost to taxpayers.The Mint previously recognized the moon landing by using the Apollo 11 mission's official patch as the reverse design on the Eisenhower and Susan B. Anthony dollars issued from 1971 to 1981. The Mint also struck the New Frontier Congressional Gold Medal presented to Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins (and Mercury astronaut John Glenn) in 2011.Copyright 2016 collectSPACE.com.

The demagogue won more Latino and black votes than the 2012 Republican nominee,â€ù Time's Michael Scherer said in one particularly bruising paragraph.Among the descriptions of what it called â€œTrumpâ€™s America,â€ù Time described a land â€œwhere a hijab-wearing college student in New York reports being attacked and jeered at in the next Presidentâ€™s name, where American-born children ask their citizen parents if Trump will deport them, where white supremacists throw out Nazi salutes in Washington meeting halls for their President-elect.â€ù [It is worth noting that President Obama is still in charge until Januar"foxnews,Supermoon lunar eclipse in pictures,"Supermoon lunar eclipse in picturesStargazers around the world received a treat on Sunday thanks to the rare celestial phenomenon of a blood-red â€˜supermoonâ€™ eclipse.

On that day in 1908, the massive Tunguska asteroid event smashed over 770 square miles of terrain in Siberia in an explosion that knocked down millions of trees. The United Nations said that the point of International Asteroid Day is to â€œraise public awareness of the asteroid impact hazardâ€ù-- in other words, to work towards making sure that we all donâ€™t perish during a cataclysmic space rock impact.In the United States at least, NASAâ€™s Planetary Defence Coordination Office takes the lead on keeping track of objects that could hit Earth as well as helping to figure out what to do if they were to detect such a threat.

But a research review suggests it can happen after just one drink.Conventional wisdom, based on plenty of previous research, is that the occasional glass of wine or beer can be good for the heart, reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke as well as death from cardiovascular causes, lead study author Dr. Peter Kistler of the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute and the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, told Reuters Health.For the current study, however, researchers examined data collected on almost 900,000 people and found an 8 percent risk increase for irregular heartbeat with each alcoholic drink consumed per day.""Alcohol is not universally 'good' for the heart,"" Kistler said. ""It is beneficial for the 'plumbing' or blood supply to the heart muscle, but for the 'electrical' part of the heart or the heartbeat it is not.""The study focused on what's known as atrial fibrillation, a quivering or irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) that can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications. Untreated, the condition doubles the risk of heart-related deaths and is linked to a five-fold increased risk for stroke, according to the American Heart Association.While nobody should binge drink during the holidays, people with a history of atrial fibrillation should be especially vigilant about avoiding or limiting alcohol, Kistler said.Both men and women were equally at risk for holiday heart, researchers report in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.The study doesn't prove that an extra cocktail after dinner directly causes atrial fibrillation, the authors note.Still, they offer some theories about how spending too much time at the bar during holiday cocktail parties might be bad for the heartbeat.Drinking can damage heart cells directly and lead to small amounts of fibrous tissue within the heart causing an irregular heartbeat.The review found that people with atrial fibrillation who continue to drink are more likely to have ongoing irregular heartbeats even after a common surgery to repair the heart's electrical system and fix the source of the flutter.Heart muscle cells contract in a coordinated way by movement of electrical signals between cells. Over time, drinking may actually change these electrical signals, triggering irregular heartbeat.Alcohol may also trigger an irregular heartbeat by stimulating what's known as the autonomic nervous system, which controls bodily functions such as heart rate, digestion and breathing.More research still needs to be done to determine the specific mechanisms behind the relationship between alcohol and irregular heartbeat, the authors note. Causes may include alcohol's contribution to obesity, sleep and breathing problems, and high blood pressure, the authors speculate.One challenge with the study and most research on the heart effects of alcohol is that researchers rely on people to accurately recall and report on how much they drink, a flawed process that often leads participants to underestimate their alcohol consumption, noted Tim Stockwell, director of the Center for Addictions Research and a professor at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.Often, studies that count former drinkers as 'abstainers' can obscure the effects of alcohol on the heart, too, making occasional drinkers look healthier than abstainers, Stockwell, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email.Even so, there are some common sense steps anyone can take to lower the odds of heart rhythm problems after that next holiday party.""Certainly drinking with food, interspersing with non-alcoholic drinks and generally keeping the dose of alcohol low are all recommended,"" Stockwell said. ""This all reduces the heart's exposure to cardiotoxins."""foxnews,Feds Give Congress Blank Documents to 'Explain' Lab Data Manipulation,"By Ethan Barton | The Daily CallerU.S. Geological Survey (USGS) officials left Texas Republican Rep.

The Bahrain government is hosting its â€œnational dayâ€ù reception at President-elect Donald Trumpâ€™s elegant D.C. property Wednesday. This, amid reports that delegations from foreign countries are eagerly snapping up pricy rooms at the Pennsylvania Avenue location.Taken together, the developments give a snapshot of the kind of ethical entanglements Trump could face with his newest luxury property -- and the broader conflict of interest questions surrounding his business empire -- as he prepares to move into the White House less than a mile away.One Asian diplomat recently told The Washington Post: ""Why wouldn't I stay at his hotel blocks from the White House, so I can tell the new president, 'I love your new hotel!' Isn't it rude to come to his city and say, 'I am staying at your competitor?'""Larry Noble, general counsel with the Campaign Legal Center, cited this kind of scenario as a problem.â€œThey are saying that of course we'll stay at the Trump hotel. We're going to see the president and when we see the president, we want to say you have a wonderful hotel there,â€ù he told Fox News. â€œSo he's really profiting from this. It really creates real conflicts of interest.â€ùAt issue is the â€œforeign emoluments clauseâ€ù of the Constitution, which bars U.S. government officials from accepting gifts from foreign powers without congressional approval.Bahrain isnâ€™t the only foreign government sending money into the Trump Organizationâ€™s coffers this month. The Azerbaijani Embassy is hosting a Hanukkah party at the Trump hotel next week.Trump and his family say theyâ€™re trying to put up the necessary firewalls to settle any ethical questions.Shortly after his election, Trump declared he would be distancing himself from the business and making sure his children take on a bigger role in the Trump Organization.He and daughter Ivanka told CBSâ€™ â€œ60 Minutes the companyâ€™s brand paled in comparison to the importance of governing.â€œI don't think it matters. This is so much more important,â€ù Ivanka Trump said. â€œAnd more serious. And so â€_ you know, that's the focus.â€ùDonald Trump echoed his daughter messageâ€œThis is big league stuff. This is â€_ our country. Our country is going bad. We're going to save our country. I don't care about hotel occupancy. It's peanuts compared to what we're doing,â€ù he said.With the president-elect now promising a Dec. 15 news conference where he will officially turn over the business to his children, good government groups are suggesting that is not enough â€“ and the entire family should get out of the business.â€œI think this is a really dangerous area and I think he's going to see it,â€ù Noble said. â€œHopefully he's going to see it, and they're just going to divest.â€ùIn one curious development, while Ivanka Trump and her father said she and her siblings were taking on a bigger role in the business, reports have surfaced that she and her husband are moving to Washington â€“ suggesting she may instead be taking on a bigger role in the government and raising more questions of whoâ€™s poised to run the family business.Ed Henry currently serves as Fox News Channel's (FNC) chief White House correspondent.

This suggests that mental health service providers may help states screen people who could harm themselves or others with firearms, the researchers said.In the study, the researchers, led by Bindu Kalesan, an assistant professor of medicine at Boston University, looked at media reports of school shootings in the U.S. that happened between 2013 and 2015. The researchers used media reports because there is no official, comprehensive national data source on school shootings.The researchers also looked at certain factors that could be linked to how frequently these shootings occurred. Besides background checks and mental health services, the researchers also looked at how many people in a state owned guns and how much money states spent overall on education in schools, from kindergarten through grade 12.The researchers found that there were 154 school shootings between 2013 and 2015, and that 39 states had at least one school shooting during this three-year period. Of those states, 34 had fewer than 10 school shootings during this time period.Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas each had 10 to 15 school shootings during the three-year period, according to the study, which was published today (Dec. 6) in the journal Injury Prevention.However, 11 states had no school shootings during the same three-year period. These states included Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia and Wyoming. (The shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Connecticut, happened in December 2012, prior to the study period.)When the researchers looked at their data, they also found that school shootings were less likely to occur in states that spent more money on K-12 education than in those that spent less money on education for students in those grades. This finding is in line with previous research that has suggested that there is a link between increased spending on education and lower levels of crime and violence, the researchers said.This study was observational, so the researchers noted that they cannot firmly conclude that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between background checks or other factors and school shootings.But the rising incidence of school shootings shows that there is a need for a national registry to monitor such events, so that the causes of these traumatic events can be better understood, they said.Originally published on Live Science."foxnews,Ohio on track to ban abortion after six weeks of pregnancy,foxnews,Hit Video Game â€œOverwatchâ€ù Has Big Night at 2016 Game Awards,"Awards galore for some of the biggest games.FOXâ€™s Eammonn Dignam has more in this weeks â€œFOX Bitsâ€ù:Your insiders cheat code to gaming, Iâ€™m Eammonn Dignam.It was a night of jeans and dinner jackets at the 2016 Game Awards in Los Angeles where host Geoff Keighly announced â€œGame of the Yearâ€ù:â€œOverwatchâ€ù pulling in four awards for that night.â€œThat Dragon, Cancerâ€ù creator Ryan Green delivering an emotional speech for his game that memorialized his young boys battle with cancer:That game winning the â€œGames for Impactâ€ù award:Hideo Kojima was given the â€œ2016 Industry Icon Awardâ€ù:After being banned in 2015 because of a public breakup between him, and his former bosses at publisher Konami.Thatâ€™s FOX Bits for FOX News.Watch the whole thing here:Follow Eammonn Dignam on Twitter: @FOXBits247"foxnews,Hot Hollywood mamas,"Kourtney was proud of her 33 pound post-baby weight loss when she had Mason.

The Ayatollah Khamenei warned the day before Thanksgiving that if the U.S. dared to extend sanctions on Iran, the Islamic Republic would retaliate. President-elect Trump, meanwhile, has vowed to cancel the deal altogether, which would almost certainly include restored and new sanctions. Who will blink first?The House of Representatives already set the confrontation on course last week, when it re-authorized the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) for ten years. This was an almost entirely symbolic move, however, as the ISA will expire at the end of this year unless the Senate approves it and Barack Obama signs it, and Obama is about as likely to do that as he is to put on a Make America Great Again cap.Indeed, Obama continues to be notoriously protective of the Iran deal. The known elements of the deal are bad enough, as I explain in my book ""The Complete Infidelâ€™s Guide to Iran."" But the secret codicils just keep making things worse, and administration officials continue to appear determined that they not leak out to the public.Investigative journalist Adam Kredo reported last Tuesday that â€œsenior Obama administration officials in their final days in office are seeking to cover up key details of the Iran nuclear deal from Congress, according to documents and sources who spoke to the Washington Free Beacon about continued efforts by the White House to block formal investigations into secret diplomacy with Tehran that resulted in a $1.7 billion cash payment by the United States.â€ùAs far as Khamenei was concerned, Obamaâ€™s obvious anxiousness to keep the mullahs happy was all for show. He proclaimed: â€œThe current U.S. government has breached the nuclear deal in many occasions.â€ùIn reality, Iran is the one breaching the agreement: recently, according to Reuters, the International Atomic Energy Agency revealed that Iran had â€œexceeded a soft limit on sensitive material set under its nuclear deal with major powers.â€ùThis was â€œthe second time Tehran has surpassed the 130 metric tonne threshold for heavy water, a material used as a moderator in reactors like Iranâ€™s unfinished one at Arak, since the deal was put in place in January.â€ùThe Obama State Departmentâ€™s response was feeble: it was all just an accident, you see. State spokesman Mark Toner put the best face on things that he could, confusing impunity with good faith and insisting: â€œItâ€™s important to note that Iran made no effort to hide this, hide what it was doing from the IAEA.â€ùThis ongoing Obama administration solicitude for Iran may have fostered complacency in Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who boasted right after the election that there was no chance of Trump rolling back the deal. â€œIranâ€™s understanding in the nuclear deal,â€ù Rouhani explained, â€œwas that the accord was not concluded with one country or government but was approved by a resolution of the UN Security Council and there is no possibility that it can be changed by a single governmentâ€_.The United States no longer has the capacity to create Iranophobia and to create a consensus against Iran. The constructive engagement policies of Iran towards the world, and the fact that international sanctions have been lifted, have placed the Iranian economy on a road where there is no possibility of going backwards.â€ùKhamenei was apparently a bit less certain that it would be all smooth sailing from here on out, as he felt compelled to add a threat: â€œThe latest is extension of sanctions for 10 years, that if it happens, would surely be against JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the official name of the Iran nuclear deal], and the Islamic Republic would definitely react to it.â€ùIt remains to be seen whether President-elect Trump will take such threats seriously enough to back off on his pledge to â€œrip upâ€ù the Iranian nuclear deal.It is certain, however, that if he is serious about restoring Americaâ€™s national security and standing in the world, he will not be able to afford to continue Obamaâ€™s policies of ignoring Iranian breaches of the agreement and showering upon them all manner of largesse.It will either be no deal with Iran and a secure America, or a deal with Iran and continued appeasement and weakness in response to enemies who have vowed to destroy us. This is one swamp in dire need of draining.Robert Spencer is the director of Jihad Watch and author of the New York Times bestsellers The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades) and The Truth About Muhammad.

(Special to FoxNews.com)The tube, which is nearly complete, was to extend under a section of the Missouri River that the Standing Rock Sioux consider sacred ground, even though it is not on their reservation. With temperatures diving, and the lack of sanitation taking its toll, it may seem thereâ€™s nothing left to fight â€“ or celebrate. But even though some of the less hardy have gone their separate ways, tribal elders vowed this week that it is an â€œabsoluteâ€ù they will remain.â€œThe greater fight is the corporations raping the earth,â€ù Margaret Engle Reyes, an activist who traveled to the camp last week, told FoxNews.com. â€œThat is the real fight and will continue. People here are used to bad snow conditions and are hunkered down. Some of the California hippie types might not stay.â€ùProtesters fear the victory â€“ which comes in the twilight days of the Obama administration â€“ is fragile. President-elect Donald Trump has the power to overturn the decision when he takes office next month, and has vowed to make energy independence a top priority.Related Image Expand / Contract Shelter is scarce, and some of the locals resent outsiders, sources said. (Special to FoxNews.com)The $3.8 billion, 1,170-mile natural gas pipeline proposed and mostly completed by Energy Transfer Partners is slated to carry around 470,000 barrels of domestic crude oil per day from North Dakota to Illinois. The company claims it will be far safer and more cost effective than moving oil by rail, and officials emphasize that the project is not on reservation, but rather privately-owned land.James Reese, founder of private security firm Tiger Swan, which was hired by Energy Transfer to protect private property in early September, told FoxNews.com that law enforcement has any potential flare-ups â€œunder control,â€ù and that his battery of personnel â€“ made up mostly of Special Operations veterans â€“ will â€œcontinue to sit and make sure the equipment and private property is safe.â€ùHe is betting that his men can outlast at least most of the protesters.â€œOur assessment is that many will leave,â€ù Reese continued. â€œBut there will still be a hardcore element that will stay on and protest.â€ùA spokesperson for the Tribal Council at Standing Rock did not respond to a request for comment. At the sprawling camp, where thousands remain, there are growing concerns over health and safety. Undercover officers patrolling the camps cited overflowing toilets, bad cases of diarrhea and the spread of bronchial problems.â€œDemonstrators are having issues with pink eye, strep and pneumonias,â€ù another source on the ground said. â€œThey arenâ€™t showering for five or six days, many are sharing beds. Itâ€™s going to happen.â€ùSeveral sources cited increasing friction among the demonstrators, telling FoxNews.com that this week there has been quarrelling over supplies, huts being taken over by non-locals and a rift among leadership over whether the outside supporters are even welcome. One protester said the donations from around the nation have dried up, the vets who came have abandoned their leadership and there is a genuine fear people will die.â€œThere is some discontent between factions in the camps, and the weather is brutal,â€ù Reese said. â€œPeople are trying to sleep in cars, and carbon monoxide poisoning is a concern. There are over 100 vehicles in snow banks crashed on the side of the road. People are trying to leave but donâ€™t know where to go. Visibility is about 50 feet. If you arenâ€™t ready for this environment, you will die.â€ùRob Keller, spokesman for the Morton County Sheriffâ€™s Department, said that they have opened up a community center and schools in the area for demonstrators to seek shelter, and highlighted that the weather has made this a â€œlife or death situation.â€ù Keller noted that there was little logic or reason for people to remain in the camps, but said they would not forcibly remove people. Yet many demonstrators insisted that the bigger fight remains as firm as ever, claiming that the construction is only temporarily halted, and that the drilling will go on.â€œThis fight will end when we see the end of the outdated fossil fuel era, when this greed and destruction has been replaced by the sanity of sustainable systems that honor our earth and its people,â€ù stressed activist Nicole Fantl.If the elements, supplies and health risks werenâ€™t enough, there is always the danger violence could break out between law enforcement and demonstrators.â€œYou can still do security and you can be nice. But when they start throwing stones and rolling propane bombs at you, it is not being nice anymore,â€ù Reese said. â€œWe are outnumbered thousands to one. The law enforcement is outnumbered hundreds to one. It is a small law enforcement [presence] here and they are tapped out, these protesters are taking away other officers from their community. The locals are tired, their livestock is missing. This has been going on for months.â€ùLaw enforcement has characterized the protest as lawless, and more than 400 have been arrested. While most of the protesting is taking place in North Dakota, security and intelligence personnel did span South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois over steep concerns that the situation will spill over.Several sources also told FoxNews.com that protesters threatened the lives of employees and other figures connected to Energy Transfer Partners in Texas, which in recent weeks became a point of great concern for them and their families, some of who consulted private guard firms.However, protesters have vehemently denied unlawful behavior and paint a very different picture.â€œIt is a peaceful prayer camp and people adhere to and respect that. The people are respectful, conscious, educated and socially aware. The water protectors are not doing anything to warrant the violence against them,â€ù protester and filmmaker Elias Matar, 52, said, before hinting that some were concerned their electronic devices were hacked and tapped. â€œThere have been frequent incidents of phones displaying strange behavior.â€ùJamie Brennan contributed to this report"foxnews,Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel leads task force to assist immigrants under Trump,"Ever since Republican Donald Trump won the presidential election, Chicago-area politicians like Mayor Rahm Emanuel and U.S. Rep. Luis GutiÃ©rrez, both Democrats, have vowed to fight his proposal to deport millions of people living in the country illegally.Now they are taking into action. On Tuesday, Emanuel, GutiÃ©rrez and Sen. Richard Durbin announced a new task force called â€œChicago Is With Youâ€ù that will work to protect and assist immigrants in the city.â€œAt a time when the anti-immigrant rhetoric is at a fever pitch, Chicago is going to do everything we can to make sure that we keep families and communities safe,â€ù GutiÃ©rrez said in a press release, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.The 23-member group will be co-chaired by the three politicians and will include aldermen, immigration advocates as well as union, business, religious and community leaders.According to officials, the task force will â€œcollaborate on mental health, legal services, diversity training for employers and education [in an attempt to offer] comprehensive services to immigrants, refugees and other disenfranchised communities.â€ùMore On This... Jeff Sessions' choice as attorney general draws both applause and angerEmanuel has vowed to maintain Chicagoâ€™s status as a so-called â€œsanctuary cityâ€ù that doesnâ€™t cooperate with immigration agencies on deporting undocumented migrants. While Trump has threatened that any sanctuary city won't receive federal funding, the mayor said that there has been a â€œtremendous show of supportâ€ù for his position, with a number of organizations pledging their support and expertise in the endeavor.â€œThe task force brings all of those resources together under a common goal to ensure we are delivering comprehensive services to these communities in need,â€ù Emanuel said, according to the Sun-Times.The ""Chicago Is With You"" initiative includes a website that will provide information to immigrants and people who entered the country illegally and are protected from deportation by Barack Obamaâ€™s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).GutiÃ©rrez has said that an effort to revoke DACA would constitute a â€œdeclaration of war.â€ùFor his part, Durbin was quoted in the statement as saying that he was proud to be part of the task force.â€œHistory will judge where we stood when families feared being ripped apart by deportation or turned away as they fled terrorism or violence around the world,â€ù he said.Earlier in the week, Trump called Emanuel, who served as Obamaâ€™s first chief of staff, reportedly to ask advice about the transition to the White House. They were scheduled to meet in New York City on Wednesday morning.About their conversation, Emanuel told reporters, â€œWe talked about a range of things that he was interested [in] and a range of things that I wanted to be clear about,â€ù according to the Sun-Times.â€œIâ€™m also not a shrinking violet,â€ù he said.Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram"foxnews,Surging Colts host slumping Texans in key AFC South battle,"Just under two months ago, following their spirited fourth-quarter rally to victory over the Indianapolis Colts, the Texans owned a two-game lead in the AFC South, including a pair of victories over their most threatening divisional rivals.As a testament to how quickly wind changes directions in the NFL, the Colts (6-6) will host Houston (6-6) on Sunday at Lucas Oil Stadium with a share of first place in the division on the line. With the Tennessee Titans (6-6) also tied atop the division, the Texans are in the precarious position of having to not only fend off the Colts and Titans for a division title that once seemed theirs to lose, but they must also reverse the nosedive that put Indianapolis and Tennessee in position to swipe the AFC South.While the Colts have won three of four, Houston has dropped three consecutive games. The Texans' offensive woes have been longstanding yet their recent late-game defensive collapses are equally troubling. Injuries have undermined them defensively, with cornerback Johnathan Joseph (ribs), linebacker John Simon (chest) and end Jadeveon Clowney (wrist/elbow) missing varying lengths of time recently.But the bigger picture is the Texans have gagged up what previously appeared to be a comfortable lead in a widely panned division. While the Texans rarely performed like a juggernaut, they won just enough over the first half of the season to seem viable as a postseason lock. Now that their record matches their uneven efforts, the Texans appear to be in serious trouble as the stretch run approaches.""I don't know,"" Texans coach Bill O'Brien said after being asked what's different between his team now as opposed to in mid-October. ""I think every week is different. I'm not sure what's different about our team right now. I think we've got to get back on the winning side of things. What's different is we've lost three in a row and we've got to get back on the winning side of things. Our guys realize that.""The Texans listed Joseph and Clowney as day-to-day on Wednesday and appear to be preparing for the likelihood of both playing against the Colts. The same could be said of wide receiver Jaelen Strong, who has missed four games with an ankle injury.For a team seeking even the smallest measure of good news, a return to relative good health qualifies. The remaining challenge is maintaining a positive perspective.""A three-game losing streak can get a lot of guys down, especially guys that are young that have never lost like that coming from college,"" Texans wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins said. ""Just to show them, it's a long NFL season. I've seen a lot of teams with losing records make it to the playoffs and go deep. You just have to encourage those guys.""The Colts find themselves in a different role after having built momentum with their recent success. Indianapolis pulled out of its tailspin after blowing a 14-point lead to the Texans in the first meeting, overcoming a spate of injuries to find stability on both sides of the ball and set the stage to take the division lead on their home turf.""We can't sit here -- you look back at that game and where we were record-wise, it would be real easy to go 'woe is me' and fold your tent, but that's not our character,"" Colts coach Chuck Pagano said. ""That's not our foundation. That's not in our DNA because of our players and because of our staff, our coaches. They do such a great job.""Injuries haven't completely abandoned the Colts. Tackle Denzell Goode and defensive tackle Zack Kerr are in concussion protocol while safety Clayton Geathers is week-to-week with a neck injury. The team is hopeful that linebacker Robert Mathis can give it a go on Sunday despite a biceps injury described as ""minor.""Mathis' availability would be a boon following the bad news received on Tuesday when linebacker D'Qwell Jackson was suspended for the remainder of the regular season for use of performance-enhancing substances. Jackson hasn't missed a regular-season game since 2009 while with the Browns and has started all 12 games for the Colts this season, posting a team-high 78 tackles and two fumble recoveries.Given the stakes, neither team is leaning on maladies as an excuse.""We know what situation we're in,"" Colts running back Frank Gore said. ""I know they also may change because they're the same way. It's going to be a tough game. We just want to go out there and try to get a win. Get a win and put us in a better situation. We know it's going to be tough."""foxnews,Shannen Doherty's husband says business manager ruined their sex life,"Shannen Dohertyâ€˜s husband Kurt Iswarienko has filed a lawsuit of his own against her former management company.Iswarienko, 42, sued the actressâ€™ former business managers for ruining his intimate life with Doherty, 45, after they let reportedly her health insurance lapse in 2014, resulting in a delayed diagnosis of her breast cancer, TMZ reports.Iswarienko also accuses Tanner Mainstain Glynn & Johnson and one of its former partners of mishandling his money and getting him into bad loans that he claims ruined his credit.Doherty sued the company herself for $15 million in August 2015 for allegedly letting her insurance lapse, eventually settling a year later for an undisclosed sum.A rep for Doherty didnâ€™t immediately return a request for comment.I love my husband. @kurtiswarienko A photo posted by ShannenDoherty (@theshando) on Nov 27, 2016 at 10:54pm PSTThis article originally appeared in Page Six."foxnews,Remembering Pearl Harbor â€“ 75 Years Later,"It is a milestone moment that sadly not many survivors are still alive to see.

The samples they retrieved have helped them study the dynamics of the impactâ€” and they also report that the impact might even have provided spaces for new life to form, according to Imperial College London.""It is hard to believe that the same forces that destroyed the dinosaurs may have also played a part, much earlier on in Earth's history, in providing the first refuges for early life on the planet,â€ù Joanna Morgan, the studyâ€™s first author and a professor at Imperial College London, said in a statement. â€œWe are hoping that further analyses of the core samples will provide more insights into how life can exist in these subterranean environments.""PLUTO COULD HARBOR A SUBTERRANEAN ICY OCEANRelated Image Expand / Contract Split drill cores collected from the peak ring of Chicxulub crater.

One implication of this theory is that previous asteroid impacts in Earthâ€™s early history could have had the same effect on the rock, giving life a place to develop a very long time ago.The Yucatan impact created a phenomenon called a peak ring, which is what the researchers drilled down intoâ€” itâ€™s â€œan uneven ring of rocky hills within the crater bowl,â€ù a scientist wrote in a commentary accompanying the new study.

It takes hundreds of thousands of workers in China to assemble 200 million iPhones a year. It seems unfathomable to think the Silicon Valley tech giant could build such an operation in the U.S.Continue Reading BelowBut the more I think about it, and contrary to what many suggest, it can be done. On a strict cost per unit basis, it would not be cost or price prohibitive. But whether it will be done depends to a great extent on how much federal and state governments are willing to cough up in tax incentives to make it happen.According to IHS, a publicly traded research and analytics firm based in London, the total cost to manufacture an iPhone 7 is $224.80. IHS estimates that $219.80 of that is component costs and $5 for assembly and test. While CEO Tim Cook has scoffed at independent cost breakdowns of Apple products, IHSâ€™s tear-down analyses are usually quite accurate, in my experience.So 219.80 is fixed no matter where itâ€™s built. Since most of the components are manufactured in Asia, there will be additional shipping and logistics costs, but those are nominal. So the question becomes one of, how much more than $5 would it cost to assemble and test an iPhone in America?Apple has reportedly asked its two manufacturing partners to look into just that. Pegatron declined but Foxconn, which depends on Apple for more than half its business, wisely agreed. I think Cook wants to be prepared when it comes time to negotiate with the Donald on tax incentives. Weâ€™ll come back to that later.A Foxconn worker makes about $400 a month, so depending on where the facility is located, a low wage U.S. worker would make between four and five times that. Tack on an adder for higher taxes and insurance premiums and the incremental assembly cost would add less than $50 to the retail price of the phone, profit margin included. That is feasible, especially on a premium model.Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENTWhich brings us to the facility and equipment. Thatâ€™s where incentives come in. Apple has $180 billion parked offshore. If it repatriates just half of that under Trumpâ€™s proposed 10% repatriation tax, thatâ€™s $9 billion in incremental tax revenue the federal government has to play with. It would make sense to use some of that to incentivize Apple to build facilities here. That would cover the cost of an iPhone plant.The real elephant in the room is finding hundreds of thousands of people willing to work on an assembly line for low wages. Thatâ€™s a real problem. But consider this. Trump is looking to make good on a campaign promise and Apple would benefit from the goodwill and PR. To achieve that, they donâ€™t have to make every iPhone here. Just one model â€“ a richly featured phone â€“ would do the trick.That would solve both the worker availability and retail price elasticity issue, since users would be more willing to pay more for a premium model.Which brings us to the notion of an all American-made iPhone. That will never happen. Apple can certainly make its preference for American-made components known, but since the vast majority of its hundreds of suppliers are based in China, Taiwan and Japan and semiconductor plants cost a fortune to build, thatâ€™s a real stretch. But in time, Apple can certainly increase the percentage of American-made components in its devices.The bottom line: If Trump and Cook work together, they can definitely make a Made in America iPhone happen, as early as 2019. And I suspect they will."foxnews,'Angels' left outside the home where 3 children fatally shot,"Two days after police say a man who shot and killed three children and critically wounded their mother, neighbors placed angel figurines and stuffed animals outside the Albuquerque home.But few talked to reporters, and relatives of the children remain reluctant to disclose any information about the family as investigators work to piece together what happen on that chaotic Monday evening.Albuquerque police on Wednesday also declined to release the name of the wounded mother who is the only witness to a shooting that has rocked the largest city in New Mexico. It is the latest in a string of horrific crimes involving New Mexico children.In this latest case, authorities say George Daniel Wechsler, 45, broke into the home of his 36-year-old ex-girlfriend and waited for her and her children to get home. He then shot them before turning the gun on himself.Police have said the two had a brief relationship and that Wechsler offered to give Christmas gifts to the children several days before the shooting but the mother refused.The mother has not been identified and remains hospitalized in critical but stable condition.Wechsler was an Albuquerque native and the brother of one of the stars of ABC's ""Revenge"" television series. Wechsler's younger brother, Nick Wechsler, was also born and raised in Albuquerque but left after graduating high school to pursue acting. His biography lists George Daniel as one of his seven brothers.Nick Wechsler's publicist, Mona Loring, did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press.According to court records, George Daniel Wechsler pleaded no contest in 2003 to misdemeanor stalking and petty misdemeanor assault against a family member. He was also arrested in 2004 for reckless driving, but police say he had no felony record.His Linkedin page says he worked briefly as a corrections officer for the Florida-based GEO Group Inc. â€” a company that specializes in corrections, detention and mental health treatment. A spokesman for GEO Group did not return an email from The Associated Press.A man cleaning out the trailer Wednesday where Wechsler lived also refused to speak to a reporter.The city of Albuquerque announced late Wednesday it would hold a ""Angel Tree Lighting"" Thursday evening to celebrate the lives of children who have been lost to abuse and violence.Earlier this year, police found Victoria Martens' dismembered body inside the apartment she shared with her mother after officers responded to a pre-dawn call about a disturbance on the day the girl was supposed to celebrate her 10th birthday.Authorities believed the girl's boyfriend and a boyfriend's cousin gave the girl drugs and raped her before killing her.___Associated Press writers Rhonda Shafner in New York contributed to this report.___Follow Russell Contreras on Twitter at http://twitter.com/russcontreras .

Not quite -- in many ways, he appears a successor to LBJ.Following the unprecedented election of Donald J. Trump, many continue to look for precedents. The real estate magnateâ€™s intervention with Carrier reminded columnist Peggy Noonan of JFKâ€™s engagement with the steel industry. Others have likened Trumpâ€™s unlikely campaign to that of another celebrity who upset the established order â€“ Ronald Reagan.The better comparison may be with Lyndon Baines Johnson. LBJ was a crude, rude and not especially popular president who got things done. Unlike President Obama, Johnson was willing to roll up his sleeves and jawbone legislators and business leaders in order to get bills passed and to move the country forward. Thatâ€™s how he was able to sign civil rights legislation in an era when opposition to racial equality came mainly from Republicans but also from vehement members of his own party â€“ the Southern Democrats. He made life impossible for his foes, bullying and wheedling until the bills passed, in the process forever changing the makeup of the Democratic Party.Trump is engaged in something similar. He is already changing the discourse between the corporate world and the Republican Party. In calling out CEOs for ignoring the welfare of their own workers by moving operations overseas, by threatening retaliatory measures against firms that flee the country, and by opposing trade deals like the TPP largely crafted by corporate titans, he is upending the Chamber of Commerce-GOP partnership that has shaped economic policy for decades.To continue reading Liz Peekâ€™s column in the Fiscal Times, click here.Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!O'REILLY: Back to Fox segment tonight. How to solve the border mess.Joining us from Washington, Senator Marco Rubio from Florida.So Senator, top of the program we told the audience about polls that are coming in now on the border crisis. President Obama getting hammered. The vast majority of Americans think he is doing a terrible job there. However, just 23 percent of Americans believe the Republicans in Congress, of which you are one are doing a good job. 23 percent. So you guys are getting a blast as well. So my question to you is, if you were the president of the United States how would you stop this humanitarian disaster down there?SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R) FLORIDA: Well, first of all, it wouldn't have happened because I never would have signed an executive order granting a deferred action to those who were in this country illegally. I think he was showing a tremendous amount of compassion, but that was not the right way to do it. It sent a message that actually invited people to come, and you see the disaster that has followed. The second thing, I would say, is that the first step in this process needs to be an all-out effort to finally put to rest the illegal immigration problem in America. And this involves the construction of strategic fencing, but also the deployment of specific technologies like ground sensors and cameras and drones and so forth to secure the southern border with Mexico. It involves a verify system, to require employers to verify that the people they are hiring are legally here. It involves an entry-exit tracking system, particularly at our airports, because 40 percent of our illegal immigration problem are people that enter the country legally and overstay visas. That would be the first step in this process, you have to do every single aspect of it, and only after you do that can you move to step two, which is reforming the legal immigration .O'REILLY: And I agree with you 100 percent, you have got to stop - you've got to stop the madness first. But let's deal with the kids now because this is the humanitarian crisis the whole world is watching. Number one, you have no fence in these hot sectors, you say we should. And I agree. Number two, Governor Perry of Texas is asking and has asked for years, the National Guard to get down and help the border patrol. Do you favor that?RUBIO: I do, and again, that has to do with manpower and that would be a part of any effort to secure the border.O'REILLY: OK. So you put the guard down there, you show the world the pictures of our military on the border. Right away just those pictures then would de-incentivize the people who are paying these terrible cartels to human smuggle. So you would have a solution. All right, now, why do you think the folks are holding it against the Republicans -- are they believing President Obama when he is trying to blame you, guys, for the border madness?RUBIO: I think it is an indictment of all of Washington, of the failure for more than a decade to deal with the problem that we know exists. Unless you are in favor of the status quo, unless you look at what is happening now and say, I think, this is working for America you have to be in favor of fixing it. So that is not really the debate, the debate is how do you fix it? And in my mind, the first step in fixing this, is to stop the growth and the problem that we have right now with illegal immigration, and then to begin to erode that number, to lower it, so that you can move to step two, which is reforming the legal immigration process towards one that is based on merit and works for our country in the 21ST century.O'REILLY: OK, would you send the kids back?RUBIO: Yes, and I'll tell you why that' important. Because the leading reason why this is happening, is word of mouth is spreading that if you make it to the United States as an unaccompanied minor or as a family with children you are going to be treated differently than adults who are traveling by themselves. And that word gets back, so imagine for a moment, if someone comes across the border, as a family or as an individual, they are now released into the population, with a notice to appear, but, of course, they never will, or do. And then what happens is, they call back home, people see they made the voyage safely, and you've now created a word of mouth incentive.O'REILLY: Sure.RUBIO: For others to do the same thing.O'REILLY: All right, so you would send them back - you would get the increased courts, the judges down there to get them out, because that's going to be a big thing when that starts to happen. How many times have you spoken to President Obama personally about immigration reform?RUBIO: Well, we've spoken a couple of times, but not in more than a year. And again, my conversations always begin with, what I've been saying publicly, and that is, anyone who is in favor of immigration reform must first be in favor of border security.O'REILLY: And then how - what does he reply to that?RUBIO: Well, I think they don't necessarily - well, two points - number one, the thing they'll say is the border has never been more secure, which is true for a handful of the sectors, but not for the others, not for the Rio Grande sector, not for the other sectors that we've seen, the Tucson sector of the border where people are crossing. And that has been the real challenge, is that the argument if you recall, he gave a speech in El Paso a few years ago where he mocked people who said we needed more border security by talking about how we would insist on a moat with alligators in it. And of course, now, we've seen that the border is in fact not secure.O'REILLY: All right, Senator, we appreciate your time tonight, thank you.Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC.

It was filed by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, Campaign for Commercial Free Childhood, Center for Digital Democracy and Consumers Union.The two toys in question are ""My Friend Cayla,"" which is a talking doll that can understand and respond to kids in real-time, and the ""i-QUE"" robot, which is described as a ""quick witted, smart talking know it all.""The smart toys ask children for very specific personal information such as parent names, favorite TV shows and meals, school name and the city in which they live, the filing states. Both toys also take users' IP addresses in order to collect location data, according to their privacy policies.The coalition is asking the Federal Trade Commission to take action, since the toy manufacturer is allegedly violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and Section of 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits ""unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.""In this instance, it says, Genesis Toys could be violating both acts by not obtaining consent from a parent before recording conversations and sending them to Nuance, which the company could potentially use for marketing purposes. COPPA states that parents should have control over their kids' data and be able to access, review and even delete the data.Check out the 10 most dangerous toys of 2016:11 PHOTOS 10 most dangerous toys of 2016 See Gallery 10 most dangerous toys of 2016 Peppa Pig's Muddy Puddles Family (considered hazardous by WATCH due to the potential for choking injuries) Photo: Toysafety.org KidsTime US/Appease Toys: Baby Children's Elephant Pillow (potential for suffocation) Photo: Toysafety.org Slimeball Slinger (potential for eye injuries) Photo: Toysafety.org Banzai Bump n' Bounce Body Bumpers (potential for impact injuries) Photo: Toysafety.org Nerf Rival: Apollo XV-700 Blaster (potential for eye injuries) Photo: Toysafety.org The Good Dinosaur: Galloping Butch (potential for puncture wound injuries) Photo: Toysafety.org Peppy Pups (potential for strangulation injuries) Photo: Toysafety.org Flying Heroes: Superman Launcher (potential for eye and facial injuries) Photo: Toysafety.org Baby Magic: Feed n' Play Baby (potential for ingestion injuries) Photo: Toysafety.org Warcraft: Doomhammer (potential for blunt impact injuries) Photo: Toysafety.org Up Next See Gallery Discover More Like This of SEE ALL BACK TO SLIDE SHOW CAPTION + HIDE CAPTION â€“If they read any privacy policy at all, most parents would only look at the toy company's policy, which states that audio files are used by Nuance Communications in order to improve the product. However, it's unlikely that they'll read the Nuance Communications' policy, which is more concerning. It states that it can use the information for ""internal purpose to develop, tune, enhance, and improve our products and services, and for advertising and marketing."" What's more, the privacy policies for both companies are not easy to find and are not displayed on the toy packaging, the filing stated.This is not the first time that a talking doll raises security and privacy concerns. Last year, Mattel released Hello Barbie, which was marketed as an Internet-connected talking doll that could record conversations with kids and upload them online. However, the Hello Barbie doll only records when the button is pushed, whereas Cayla and i-QUE are on the whole time.Another concern, the complaint points out, is that Genesis and Nuance's policies can change from time to time and parents would never know.The coalition of consumer groups is asking the FTC to stop the toy manufacturer from doing anything that can be considered unfair and deceptive, which includes recording and sending audio files without consent. The complaint also asks to also offer "" other relief,"" which could potentially include refunds to unsatisfied parents.RELATED: Check out the 50 hottest toys of the past 50 years:52 PHOTOS The 50 hottest toys of the past 50 years See Gallery The 50 hottest toys of the past 50 years 1966: Twister Who saved Twister? Herrrrrrreâ€™s Johnny! The goofy board game where players are the game pieces was about to be pulled from the market when Johnny Carson and the shapely Eva Gabor played a suggestive round on â€œThe Tonight Show.â€ù Viewers demanded the game, and Twister (previously called Pretzel) became a game-room staple. It was inducted into the Toy Hall of Fame in 2015. Right hand red! 1967: Battleship â€œYou sank my Battleship!â€ù This hit board game has its roots in a pen-and-paper version that dates to the 1930s, but most 1960s kids fondly remember setting up their ships on a plastic board, using pegs to indicate the other playerâ€™s guesses. In 2012, the movie â€œBattleshipâ€ù was loosely based on the game, and sharp-eyed fans spotted a few game references. (The aliens shoot cannons at the ships that look an awful lot like the gameâ€™s plastic pegs.) 1968: Hot Wheels Kids have dreamed of driving fast cars ever since Henry Ford made us put the horses away. Mattel introduced the Hot Wheels line of die-cast cars in 1968, and theyâ€™ve been vrooming through shag carpet and over ottomans ever since. They screeched their way into the Toy Hall of Fame in 2011. 1969: Lego and Duplo The first recognizable Lego bricks were introduced in 1947, but it was in 1969 that their younger family member, the larger Duplo blocks, joined the fun. Now both older and younger siblings could build anything their imaginations could invent, and even more parents could join in the fun of stepping on a Lego brick while walking through a darkened living room. Lego was inducted into the Toy Hall of Fame in 1998, and with the release of its hit 3-D animated â€œLego Movieâ€ù in 2014, everything is indeed awesome. 1970: Lite-Brite Lite-Brite came out in 1967, but sales really lit up as the 1970s arrived. Artists of all ages use the colored pegs to poke through patterned paper to form light-up cartoon characters or other shapes, or skip the patterns entirely for free-form designs. If thatâ€™s too much work for todayâ€™s computer-raised kids, thereâ€™s now an iPad app. 1971: Tonka Trucks Tonka Trucks take their name from Minnesotaâ€™s Lake Minnetonka, near the companyâ€™s headquarters, and itâ€™s fitting that Tonka is a Dakota word for â€œbig.â€ù Tonka Trucks are big movers for little hands to play with, and they were also a big success, entering the Toy Hall of Fame in 2001. The classic yellow dump truck shown here has been hauling around Legos, Barbie dolls and other kid cargo since 1965. Their popular Jeep has been rolling since 1962, and Tonka pickups first revved their engines in 1955. 1972: Uno Unoâ€™s bright primary color scheme is familiar to families whoâ€™ve loved the fast-moving card game since the early 1970s. But if youâ€™re a fan of something, anything, thereâ€™s probably an Uno deck waiting for you: Harry Potter, Hello Kitty, Doctor Who, Elvis Presley, â€œFamily Guy,â€ù Peanuts, Coca-Cola and â€œDiary of a Wimpy Kidâ€ù are just a few of the themed Uno decks now available. 1973: Baby Alive Kids are fascinated with bodily functions, and in 1973, along came Baby Alive. Sure, feeding her the specially sold food was fun, but face it, kids were more interested in the fact that this baby doll actually filled her diapers. Somehow, years later when 1970s kids had their own children, the novelty had worn off. Todayâ€™s Baby Alive dolls are so sophisticated, they can even tell their kid moms and dads when they need to use a provided potty. 1974: Dungeons & Dragons When it first came out in 1974, iconic role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, with its dragons and elves, orcs and mages, immediately appealed to the fantasy-loving, J.R.R. Tolkien-reading cliques in every school. Now many of those D&D players have grown up to bring the game they loved into the mainstream, and youâ€™ll find elements of its mystical, fantastical play in everything from video games to computer programs to blockbuster movies and TV shows. It battled its way into the Toy Hall of Fame in 2016. 1975: Barbie Barbie Millicent Roberts is her name, and seemingly random job-hopping is her game. Barbie has been an astronaut, a flight attendant, a movie star, a veterinarian, a dentist, a fighter pilot, a paleontologist and more. Her looks have changed too, from a bubble-top hairdo with sultry downcast eyes, to a suntanned Malibu girl with tan lines, to the more modern and diverse offerings of today. Try to keep up, Ken. Barbie was inducted into the Toy Hall of Fame in 1998. 1976: Fisher-Price Little People Fisher-Price Little People arenâ€™t so little anymore. Fears of choking hazards and revised safety standards prompted the company to make them larger, but whatever the size, these colorful little figures have always occupied a big, big world. From barns that moo to zoos, amusement parks to airports, the Little People have places to go and things to do. They were inducted into the Toy Hall of Fame in 2016. 1977: Star Wars action figures The blockbuster movie â€œStar Warsâ€ù flew into a galaxy far, far away (your local cineplex) on May 25, 1977, and by that December, store shelves should have been bursting with little Lukes and Leias. But toy company Kenner was unprepared for the demand, and could only offer â€œEarly Bird Certificate Packagesâ€ù that enabled fans to redeem them for the figures when assembly lines caught up. And catch up they did, selling more than 300 million Star Wars toys from 1978 to 1985. The Force is strong with this one. Star Wars Action Figures were inducted into the Toy Hall of Fame in 2012. 1978: Simon The electronic memory game Simon had perhaps the most glamorous toy launch of all time. It was introduced at none other than infamous disco Studio 54 in New York City, and became a huge hit. It starts out simple, tweeting a pattern by flashing its brightly colored lights. But the longer you play, the more complicated â€” and faster â€” the pattern gets, and the frustration builds. â€œSimon Saysâ€ù was never this stressful. 1979: Atari 2600 Late-â€™70s and early â€™80s kids were dazzled to find an Atari 2600 video-game console under the tree. There was a special thrill to playing Pac-Man, Space Invaders and Frogger without ever having to leave the house. Sure, the graphics look laughable to kids raised on todayâ€™s virtual-reality games, but a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and this was ours. The Atari 2600 was inducted into the Toy Hall of Fame in 2007. 1980: Rubikâ€™s Cube Hungarian design teacher Erno Rubik started the 1980s off with a bang â€” even if the â€œbangâ€ù came when a frustrated Rubikâ€™s Cube owner threw the colorful puzzle against the wall. Within two years, 100 million were sold. Weâ€™re guessing the number that were actually solved is much, much tinier. Rubikâ€™s Cube was inducted into the Toy Hall of Fame in 2014. 1981: Strawberry Shortcake Dolls kept advancing â€” they talked, they ate, they crawled. And then in the â€™80s, along came Strawberry Shortcake, who â€_ smelled. The sweet little doll was scented to match her favorite fruit, and her pals â€” from Blueberry Muffin to Apple Dumpling â€” all had their own scrumptious scents. 1982: E.T. dolls Director Steven Spielbergâ€™s movie â€œE.T.: The Extra-Terrestrialâ€ù came out in June 1982, and kids fell in love with the sweet alien faster than you could say Reeseâ€™s Pieces. Sure, he was a little funny-looking, but his heart light shone through, and figures of him became a holiday hit. 1983: Cabbage Patch Kids Here it is. The toy craze that topped all toy crazes. Moms and dads made the news fighting to get into stores to buy these lumpy-faced dolls that came with their own birth certificates and individual â€” often bizarre â€” names. Aw, little Igor Ignatius, mommy loves you anyway. 1984: Trivial Pursuit Dozens of similar trivia games, not to mention a plethora of bar trivia nights, owe their existence to Trivial Pursuit, the hot board game of 1984, a year when 20 million copies were sold. Was blue (geography) your favorite category? Maybe brown (arts and literature)? The game famously made it into a â€œSeinfeldâ€ù episode, where George and the â€œBubble Boyâ€ù come to blows over a misprinted answer (Moops, not Moors). 1985: Skateboards Skateboarding has had numerous booms â€” the Z-Boys of â€œDogtown and Z-Boysâ€ù movie fame skated empty pools back in the 1970s. But when Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) traveled to school and Doc Brownâ€™s garage via skateboard in the 1985 hit movie â€œBack to the Future,â€ù skateboarding was hot once more, The skateboard was inducted into the Toy Hall of Fame in 2008. 1986: Teddy Ruxpin Good old Teddy Ruxpin was the best-selling toy of 1985 and 1986, an animatronic bear whose mouth and eyes moved while he read children stories via a cassette player implanted in his back. The inflexible plastic player didnâ€™t make him very cuddly, but in 1986 he seemed like a dazzling voice from the future. A new version, featuring Bluetooth technology, a 4GB hard drive and an optional free app, will hit stores in 2017. 1987: Care Bears The 1980s may have been the decade of greed and Gordon Gekko, but the Care Bears showed there was still plenty of love to go around. The bears feature tummy symbols (hearts, flowers, shamrocks), each representing their personality. TV cartoons and a series of movies kept them popular, and theyâ€™ve been relaunched twice since their 1980s heyday. 1988: Pictionary You didnâ€™t need any real artistic talent to win at Pictionary, the board game where players try to get their teammates to guess what theyâ€™re drawing. Stick figures were fine, and creative arm-waving and frustrated noise-making could sometimes eke a correct answer out of your partner. The best artists were actually kind of bad at the game, they concentrated too much on quality over frantic speed. 1989: Nintendo Game Boy Video games coming into the home was one thing, but the launch of the Nintendo Game Boy in 1989 meant your games could come with you. Nintendoâ€™s NES system was already a hit, and the handheld Game Boy, with popular puzzle game Tetris included, made it portable. Nintendo Game Boy was inducted into the Toy Hall of Fame in 2009. 1990: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles combine everything a human teen could love: pizza, buddies and seriously sweet ninja moves. The four Heroes in a Half-Shell, as their theme song proclaims, have all kinds of adventures fighting crime in movies, TV, and comics, and itâ€™s no wonder that their action figures were huge hits. The Turtles crawled back onscreen in 2012 when Nickelodeon relaunched the brand. After 2016â€™s â€œOut of the Shadows,â€ù the quartet has appeared in six feature films. 1991: Super Soaker If squirt guns were good, clean summer fun, a squirt gun that ups the ante had to be even better. Super Soaker high-powered water guns took the â€™90s â€” and many soon-to-be-drenched younger siblings â€” by storm. More than 200 million have been sold, in 175 different variations on the classic model. The Super Soaker was inducted into the Toy Hall of Fame in 2015. 1992: Trolls Every troll has his (or her) day. The original fuzzy-headed, funny-faced little figurines were popular in the 1960s, but they came back with a vengeance in the 1990s, dressed as clowns, brides and grooms, doctors, athletes and anything else you could imagine. Modern parents should dig out their troll dolls, whether from the 1960s or 1990s, because the 2016 animated movie â€œTrolls,â€ù starring Justin Timberlake and Anna Kendrick, is bringing fuzzy back. 1993: American Girl dolls A hundred dollars for a doll? Dads of the 1970s wouldâ€™ve snorted, but by the time the 1990s rolled around, many dads (and moms) were saying yes â€” if the $100 doll was an American Girl doll. American Girl dolls came complete with their own histories, books about their lives and fancy accessories, from bunk beds to horses and scooters. 1994: Power Rangers Go, go, Power Rangers! The franchise burst onto the scene in 1993 with its first TV show, in which a group of regular teens are trained to â€œmorphâ€ù into colorful superheroes â€” the Power Rangers â€” to fight evil. Of course kids had to have the action figures, which came in all the colors of the rangers, plus various accessories. 1995: Beanie Babies These collectible, soft, bean-bag animals caused a frenzy when introduced in the mid-1990s. Maker Ty kept the different varieties scarce, leading to stampedes at various toy stores when an exceptionally rare breed was introduced. But in the end, letâ€™s hope most of the Beanies purchased in the 1990s were played with, because as of 2016, few of even the most obsessed collectors made a profit on the plush playthings. 1996: Tickle Me Elmo How could a sweet little guy like Elmo from â€œSesame Streetâ€ù cause knock-down, drag-out fights? The giggly little stuffed animal was the hit toy of Christmas 1996, and when stores sold out on Black Friday, shoppers became desperate. Manufacturer Tyco couldnâ€™t keep up with supply, and Tickle Me Elmo shouldâ€™ve probably been renamed Trample Me Elmo. Variations of the toy continue to come out, but none can touch the original mania. 1997: Tamagotchi These teeny-tiny egg-shaped computers with the funny name were the hit of the 1997 holiday season. The hand-held toy is a pet-simulation game, in which an owner has to feed and tend his or her egg and raise it properly to adulthood, or it could get sick and even die. Seems like a lot of pressure for a kid to take on, but apparently they were up to the challenge, because more than 80 million have been sold. 1998: Furby Forget Pig Latin: In 1998, the language to speak was Furbish, the mysterious jibber-jabber that issued forth from the robotic little Furbys for which every kid seemed to yearn. Furbys rolled their eyes and moved their mouths while they blabbed, and eventually, they even learned a little English. Parents, however, just wondered how they could get the things to keep quiet. 1999: Pokemon Gotta catch â€™em all! Today kids with smartphone access can play Pokemon Go, and walk around their neighborhoods catching Pikachus and Magikarps, but in the 1990s, it was a game of trading cards, video games and toy figurines. Some schools banned any mention of Pokemon for fear of shattered friendships over bad trades. 2000: Razor Scooter It used to be kids mostly got around on foot, with an occasional bike, pair of roller skates or skateboard helping out. The Razor Scooter gave kids the power of transportation like theyâ€™d never had before, and they loved it. 2001: Beyblades Think â€œtops,â€ù and you may envision Pa Ingalls whittling an innocent spinning toy for Little Half-Pint Laura to play with during long, cold winter nights on the prairie. Not Beyblades. These are tops that mean business, and come complete with launchers to help them rev their way up to speed and tackle an opponent. A Japanese manga series helped popularize the toys. 2002: Bratz dolls From their bold name to their cutting-edge fashions and troweled-on makeup, Bratz dolls were controversial from the beginning. And thatâ€™s just the way their owners liked them. Though the Barbie-with-a-bad-side dolls started off selling slowly, by 2006 the New Yorker reported they had captured nearly half of the fashion-doll market. 2003: Robosapiens What kid doesnâ€™t want his or her own robot, whether thatâ€™s a warrior or a dinosaur! Robosapiens can walk, grab things and vocalize, and a 21-button remote allows owners to execute 67 commands. A dog (Robo-Pet) and dinosaur (Robo-Raptor) soon joined the family. 2004: Dancing Dora the Explorer Thereâ€™s never been an adventure Dora the Explorer isnâ€™t up for, or a puzzle she canâ€™t solve. Along with her beloved monkey Boots and her handy purple backpack, the world is at her feet. In 2004, Dancing Dora didnâ€™t just dance, she sang and spoke both English and Spanish. 2005: Xbox 360 Itâ€™s since been supplanted by the Xbox One, but the Xbox 360 remains one of the most influential gaming consoles of its time, and it was hard to get your hands on one when it first came out. Lines at electronics stores rivaled lines to get concert tickets or see the latest â€œStar Warsâ€ù film. Part of its popularity came from its Xbox Live online gaming options, making the sometimes solitary hobby feel as much like a community as the old days of hanging around the arcade with your pals. 2006: Nintendo Wii Video games were often criticized for creating a generation of couch potatoes. Not so the Nintendo Wii, which started kids (and adults) jumping, dancing and getting exercise, all without leaving their living rooms. But players had to be wary while getting their workouts. Early TV newscasts showed more than one Wii enthusiast accidentally letting go of the handheld remote and fatally flinging it into their TV screen. 2007: â€˜Carsâ€™ everything Lightning McQueen, the red sports car star of the 2006 animated hit â€œCars,â€ù quickly became the most personality-laden vehicle since Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. And kids wanted him on everything, from bedsheets to Halloween costumes â€” and, of course, model cars. His cocky confidence sent Lightning racing to the top of holiday wish lists. Little Red Corvette, baby youâ€™re much too fast. Or maybe youâ€™re just right. 2008: iPod Touch The original iPod was a great step forward for those who wanted to take their music with them. But the iPod Touch took what its predecessor could do and all but said, â€œWatch THIS.â€ù Kids and adults alike saw the snazzy touch screen so familiar from the iPhone and never looked back. Pump up the volume, and now it comes with video. 2009: Zhu Zhu Pets Zhu Zhu Pets were priced at just $9, but during the rush to get them during the 2009 holidays, many sold on the secondary market for more than $60. Thatâ€™s a lot of lettuce for a cute little hamster that can go into two modes â€” the cuddly â€œnurturing modeâ€ù or the investigative â€œadventure mode.â€ù Theyâ€™re also graced with some of the cutest toy names ever, from NumNums to Mr. Squiggles. 2010: iPad It seemed everyone wanted an iPad in 2010, and kids were no exception. And why not? The tablet computer let them play games, take photos, shoot video, play music and pretty much do everything Mom and Dadâ€™s laptop or desktop computer can do, without the weight of a pesky keyboard. 2011: Monster High dolls Kids have always loved monsters and dolls, but not since the old Aurora model days have creepy creatures been such popular toy figures. Monster High is a high school attended by relatives of the classic monsters of old, all with different traits and talents relating to their famed ancestors. These are not your fatherâ€™s horrific monsters â€” theyâ€™re so family friendly that Draculaâ€™s daughter, Draculaura, is a vegan who faints at the sight of blood. 2012: Lego Friends Girls had always played with Lego, but in 2012, the new Lego Friends line aimed right for them, with a distinct feminine focus. The five main characters, dubbed mini-dolls, were all female, and were more detailed than the traditional mini-figs. The settings and backdrops too were specially designed to appeal to girls, and included a vet clinic, malt shop and beauty salon. Girl power! 2013: â€˜Frozenâ€™ toys Do you want to build a snowman? Well, if you did in 2013, after just seeing Disney megahit â€œFrozen,â€ù youâ€™d better hope it didnâ€™t have to be an officially licensed â€œOlafâ€ù snowman. Despite kids clamoring for Elsa, Anna and Olaf items, they were very tough to come by that year. What? Disney, the House the Mouse Built, failing to capitalize on merchandise opportunities? It happened, but by holiday season 2014, the stores were stocked and loaded. Most kids in 2013 though just had to â€œLet It Go.â€ù 2014: Zoomer Dino Kids roared for the robotic, trainable Zoomer Dino, who rolls around the house on his two wheels while learning the lay of the land. He can spin, chomp, roar and even attack (sorry, Fido, youâ€™ve been replaced). But kidsâ€™ favorite actions might be the naughty ones: He can also burp and break wind. 2015: BB-8 Thankfully, 2015â€™s â€œStar Wars: The Force Awakensâ€ù didnâ€™t disappoint like the 1999 series installment, â€œEpisode 1: The Phantom Menace.â€ù And even more thankfully, cute rolling droid BB-8 was way more charming than Jar-Jar Binks. Kids naturally wanted to get their Jedi on with this home robot version that can be controlled with a phone app. BB-8, phone home. Wait, wrong space movie. 2016: Hatchimals For most kids, 2016â€™s most coveted toy, the Hatchimals, wonâ€™t be hatching until January. Maker Spin Master just wasnâ€™t ready for the demand, and the Pengualas, Draggles, Owlicorns, Burtles and Bearakeets will have to stay tucked safely inside their eggs till the New Year. Once they arrive, theyâ€™ll peck their way out with the help of their owner. And while not every year has an impossible-to-find toy, 2016 has two: The Nintendo mini NES Classic Edition, complete with 30 nostalgic games, is similarly unattainable.

""We understand everybody is fighting for position. We just want to get the job done. That's all there is to it.""The Steelers (7-5) have steered their season in the right direction, winning three straight after a four-game losing streak to move into a tie with Baltimore atop the AFC North standings and within one game of Denver for the final Wild Card spot.""We are in a good situation right now, but we obviously have to win this game and better,"" Bell said.Pittsburgh controls its fate over the final four weeks of this season, but could cede that control with a single loss.""We always want to worry about what's going on in the stadium we're in,"" Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger said. ""We don't want to have to look around. We've done that in years past. For us to just have to go out and take care of our own business is good for us.""The Bills (6-6) are further out on the fringe of the playoff picture, unable to catch New England in the AFC East and seventh in the Wild Card race when tiebreakers are factored in.Buffalo likely needs to win its last four games to end the longest active playoff drought (16 seasons) in North American sports.But the Bills won four straight earlier this season, and enter a three-game homestretch hopeful they can repeat the feat.""This experience right here could be the start of something new,"" Bills linebacker Lorenzo Alexander said. ""That's what we're trying to do and trying to establish. Take seize of it right now, this opportunity that we have. If we can do that, things start to turn around.""Coming off two consecutive wins, the Bills led by two touchdowns on the road at Oakland last week before quarterback Tyrod Taylor and the Buffalo defense ""imploded,"" as coach Rex Ryan put it, allowing 29 unanswered points.Buffalo's passing offense ranks last in the NFL and the Bills are 14-12 with Taylor under center over the past two seasons. Taylor's shortcomings have raised questions about whether the Bills should opt out of the lucrative contract extension they gave Taylor prior to the season.""My future in Buffalo is this week against the Pittsburgh Steelers,"" Taylor said. ""That's what matters the most. Other than that, I don't feel like talking about my contract. We still have games to play.""Frustrated with further questioning about his future in Buffalo, Taylor abruptly ended his news conference Wednesday. ""I'm done talking,"" he said while throwing down his practice jersey.Ryan defended Taylor's play, noting injuries to receivers Sammy Watkins, Robert Woods, Percy Harvin and tight end Charles Clay, among others.""I just think it is easy to sit back and be critical, but if you are playing without five receivers in the game,"" Ryan said, ""it is going to affect you.""The Bills are optimistic Woods can return this week after missing two games with a knee sprain. It would be the first time since Week 2 the Bills have had Woods and top wideout Sammy Watkins in the lineup together.Watkins is not practicing due to lingering soreness in his surgically repaired foot. Left tackle Cordy Glenn (back), linebacker Lerentee McCray (concussion) and Alexander (rest) were also held out. Woods, Clay (knee) and cornerback Ronald Darby (concussion) were limited.In Pittsburgh, nose tackle Javon Hargrave (concussion), receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey (foot), safety Shamarko Thomas (concussion) and kicker Chris Boswell (abdomen) did not practice Wednesday. Running back DeAngelo Williams (knee) was limited.After averaging 34 points in their first four wins, the Steelers have not scored more than 28 points in each of their last three wins. A more balanced, ball-control offense has featured Bell more and more as winter approaches.Bell, a Central Ohio native, knows what it takes to thrive along the Rust Belt this time of year.""I played high school football in this weather,"" he said.

Of all the contentious topics in the world of firearms, this one elicits some of the most ferocious and deeply divided responses.It seems at choosing the right barrel length for your shotgun should be a pretty simple decisionâ€”far simpler than, say, the nuanced sciences of choke selection or the proper shot size for hunting game. But the barrel battle still wages. So, whatâ€™s the truth?First, letâ€™s outline the parameters of the shotgun barrels in question. Letâ€™s leave out the really short self-defense and law enforcement barrels. Weâ€™ll also avoid the other end of the spectrum: the 32- and 34-inch barrels worn by some competition guns.PRO-GUN ACTIVISTS, FORMER MISS OHIO CALL FOR REVISED CARRY LAWSo if youâ€™re looking for a field gun that doubles as a clay crusher in the summer, just how much pipe do you need? There are several determining factors.Balance, Swing, and HandlingIt seems that thereâ€™s some sorcery to finding a gun with great balanceâ€”the shotgun-barrel combo that is the perfect weapon in your seek-and-destroy mission against 108mm clay targets. But the mythology surrounding shotgun handling is largely thatâ€”more a result of the shooterâ€™s perception than actual measurable qualities of the gun itself.â€œPeople commenting on â€˜swingâ€™ will most certainly provide gibberish for answers, as swing is about feel,â€ù says Dave Miles, director of marketing at Mossberg. â€œSimply put: Longer, heavier barrels will swing smoother, while shorter, lighter barrels will be more maneuverable but will not offer the same â€˜swing,â€™ or momentum, that a heavier barrel has.â€ùâ€œSwing is controlled by the center of gravity of the shotgun and is a feel rather than a scientific entity,â€ù says Mossberg senior design engineer Tim Blazek. â€œSwing is affected by the combination of barrel length, barrel contour, choke style (extended or flush), receiver material, action type, stock and forearm density, rib style, and more.â€ùThere are some measurable facts in regard to balance and handling, though. The same gun, with a longer barrel, will have more weight at the muzzle. This, in turn, changes the balance point, moving it farther ahead of the action. That weight-forward bias smooths the swing.THE SHOTGUN THAT DOESNâ€™T KICKMy personal experience is that long-barreled guns handle far better for me, though part of that might have to do with my arm length and hand position on the stock. I have relatively long arms and grip the gun farther down the forearm than some other shooters, and I find that I shoot a 30-inch over/under better than a 28-inch stackbarrel, all other things being equal. When I intentionally place my hand closer to the action, the feel of the gun changes.My experiences are also scenario-specific. When hunting doves, I find that my percentages typically go up on hard-flying birds in proportion to barrel length. But there are other instancesâ€”Â_hunting grouse and rabbits in thick cover comes to mindâ€”when that extra barrel length is nothing but a hindrance, since shots will be quick and bushes and grapevines make toting a 30-inch gun a real chore. For dense cover and snap shooting, portability outweighs balance.Itâ€™s also important to bear in mind that an over/under or side-by-side will have a shorter overall length than a pump or semi-auto with the same-length barrel; a semi-auto with a 26-inch barrel will almost invariably be longer than a double with 28-inch tubes.Rifle and pistol shooters are affected by the length of sight radius, and that term has bled over into discussions regarding shotgun barrel length. But bear in mind that â€œsightingâ€ù a shotgun is very different from sighting a rifle or pistol in that your focus is on moving targets, and you are simply using the bead as a reference point for your muzzle.Shot VelocityVelocity is more easily analyzed than balance and swing since it can be measured with a chronograph. According to Blazek, with barrels measuring 20 to 32 inchesâ€”which covers the gamut of game gunsâ€” thereâ€™s a gain of about 10 feet per second per 2 inches of barrel length for standard loads, and roughly 15 fps per 2 inches for magnum loads. So the difference between a 20-inch and a 32-inch barrel will be 60 feet per second with light target loadsâ€”hardly a significant difference for barrels on either end of the spectrum.PUMP SHOTGUNS FOR LESS THAN $300: GUN REVIEWBut I wanted to test these theoretical values with a chronograph, so I rounded up 20- and 12-gauge guns with barrel lengths measuring from 24 to 28 inches. The loads I used were the same for each gun (Winchester AA Super Sport for the 12-gauge guns, Baschieri & Pellagri Dove & Quail loads for the 20s), and all of the barrels tested had Improved Cylinder chokes installed for consistency. Velocities were measured with the muzzle 12 inches from the chronograph. Here are the results:Gauge Barrel Length (in.) Average Velocity (fps) 12 22 1304 12 26 1328 12 28 1331 20 24 1092 20 26 1100 20 28 1101As you can see, the velocities didnâ€™t change much with respect to barrel length.My verdict:When youâ€™re purchasing a new shotgun, go with whatever barrel length feels best in your hands for the type of shooting youâ€™re going to do."foxnews,Pittsburgh parents charged after 2-month-old allegedly overdoses on methadone,"A Pittsburgh man and woman are facing charges after their 2-month-old baby was allegedly revived by the rescue drug Narcan and tested positive for methadone.Fox 25 Boston reported that a criminal complaint alleges the baby was brought to Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC on Oct. 11 after the babyâ€™s parents, Lorie Adkins and Erik Eakin, found him unresponsive. The baby went into respiratory arrest, the complaint stated, and the babyâ€™s urine indicated he had been exposed to methadone. The complaint stated the babyâ€™s condition improved with a dose of Narcan, the opiate antidote.Adkins told hospital staff that she takes methadone daily and that her baby must have overdosed from breastfeeding, Fox 25 Boston reported. But the babyâ€™s medical report stated that was unlikely because the level of exposure via breastfeeding would probably not have given the baby the symptoms he suffered.The complaint stated that a caseworker for the Office of Children, Youth and Families told detectives he contacted staff at the Childrenâ€™s Home, a local nonprofit that cares for medically fragile babies, who informed him the infant was not breastfed. Staff told the detective that while the baby was weaning off methadone, Adkins had to feed him formula because she was not producing enough milk to pump.Fox 25 Boston reported that warrants have been issued for the parents.

The iconic American brand has announced it will be donating the doors from Sam Waltonâ€™s first Arkansas outpost to Smithsonianâ€™s National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.Sam Walton opened his first Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Ark. in 1945. After being in business for five years, Walton had to relocate when his landlord refused to renew his lease. According to the Walmart Museum, Walton relocated the store to Bentonville, and within the first year he was commanding impressive six-figure sales.Related Image Expand / Contract The original Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Ark. in 1945. (Photo courtesy of The Walmart Museum)After the Arkansas store proved successful, Bud Walton, Samâ€™s brother, opened a second outpost in Ruskin Heights, Mo., a Kansas City suburb. In 1962, Sam Walton opened his first eponymous Wal-Mart after successfully managing nine Ben Franklin stores. At the time, offering low priced goods in rural communities was the main company focus.Today, Walmart operates over 11,000 stores in 28 countries, under 60 different brands names.SURPRISING FACTS ABOUT WALMART FOODYet despite its major global presence today , artificats from the early days of Walmart are few and far between, says Alan Dranow, the director of the Walmart Museum.â€œWe had absolutely no artifacts, nothing from that store because nobody held onto them,â€ù Dranow told FoxNews.com. â€œNobody knew that Walmart was going to be what Walmart became or that Sam was going to become what he became.â€ùEnter the doors from the very first Ben Franklin store.Related Image Expand / Contract Photo courtesy of The Walmart Museum (Visitors take in an exhibit at the Walmart Museum in Bentonville, Ark. )According to Dranow, the doors were kept for decades in a warehouse by Gene Ivy, co-owner of the Arkansas-based contractor Ivy Brothers Construction. The company was charged with renovating Waltonâ€™s first store in Newport in the 1960s-- and the original doors have been kept in storage since then.Ivy kept the doors in his garage after he retired. When he died in 2014, one of his grandchildren contacted a Walmart employee about what to do with salvaged store relics. The Walmart Museum, which first opened in 1990 as the Walmart Visitor Center, was more than happy to take in the prized store relics this summer.But Dranow admits the doors have seen their share of wear and tear.""Because Waltonâ€™s store was so popular he had more traffic than anybody. The door is worn on the side where you push to get in,â€ù Dranow told FoxnNews.com. â€œTheyâ€™re not really in great condition.

No specific date has been set for the doorâ€™s displayâ€”a representative from the Smithsonian would not confirm when the new exhibit will open-- but Dranow says the shipping process is now coming into place.HOSTESS LAUNCHES DEEP-FRIED TWINKIES EXCLUSIVELY ATWALMARTâ€œWeâ€™re preparing it [the door] for shipping because you canâ€™t just ship it on one of our trucks,â€ù says the museum director. â€œWeâ€™ve got thousands of trucks but this is not something you just put on a truck thatâ€™s shipping packaged product.

""To have that formatted digitally so you can do lots of science with it will be transformative in terms of the quality of information we'll have to conserve species.""Isaak said annual surveys could provide snapshots so scientists can see how biodiversity and ecosystems change over time. Because of the project's immense scale, he said, sample collecting likely will require help from many entities, including citizen scientists.The map eventually will include everything from insects to salmon to river otters. It's possible because of a new technology that can identify stream inhabitants by analyzing water samples containing DNA. The technology also can be used to identify invasive species.That technology is evolving, said Michael Schwartz, the Forest Service's director of the National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation in Missoula, Montana. Currently, he said, scientists can detect only one species at a time in a stream sample. He said the goal is to identify multiple species in a single test from one sample. A rough estimate for when that might be possible is about a year, he said.The trove of information has the potential to be so vast that questions not presently imagined might arise.""Any time science undertakes large projects like this, the payouts can be in directions you don't expect,"" Schwartz said.Ultimately, he said, the publicly available information could be used by someone with an iPad or other device who could go to a section of river and see what species it contains.The Aquatic Environmental DNA Atlas for the western U.S. has its genesis in a smaller-scale project called the Bull Trout Environmental DNA Atlas involving five states â€” Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington â€” where the federally protected fish is found. That effort, Isaak said, has discovered bull trout in areas where they were thought not to exist.Isaak also has been working on something called the Cold Water Climate Shield to identify streams that could serve as a refuge for cold water species, such as bull trout, if global warming continues. That map uses millions of temperature recordings going back decades and has expanded to include most of the western U.S. Stream temperatures in lower elevations have risen several degrees over the past 30 years, Isaak said. The DNA Atlas has been confirming the kind of species present as predicted by the Cold Water Climate Shield, Schwartz said.What scientists ultimately hope to do is combine all the information from stream temperatures, DNA Atlas sampling, topography and weather patterns to get more insights into species distribution patterns and even how entire ecosystems function.""The data sets can be bigger because computers are bigger,"" Isaak said.Even for Isaak, who is called a visionary by his colleagues, the leaps in technology that make his ideas possible can be mind-boggling.""It's just been an ongoing revelation,"" he said, recalling 15 years ago using pencil and paper to make streamside observations. ""It still seems like magic to me that you can go take a water sample and you have instruments powerful enough to discern what species are present."""foxnews,'Jeopardy!' contestant dies of cancer week before episode airs,"A â€œJeopardy!â€ù episode airing next week has taken an emotional turn after one of its contestants, Cindy Stowell, died of cancer at the age of 41 on Monday.Stowell, a science-content developer from Austin, Texas, taped the quiz show back in August, and the episode is set to premiere on Dec. 13, a â€œJeopardy!â€ù spokesperson confirmed.

I remember going out there.â€ùSteve went out into the forest where he remembers seeing a large group of other military personnel had already gathered including Staff Sgt Jim Burroughs, Airman First Class Edward Cabansag and Airman First Class Larry Warren.Describing the UFOs, he said: â€œThey looked like fluorescent coloured lights, like red and green, glowing lights and thatâ€™s what they looked like.I could see them hovering over the treetops like an eye that was almost following everybody.â€ùMYSTERIOUS UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT CRASHES IN MYANMARHe added: â€œIt was real kind of quiet and this thing hovering over the trees, and you were like kind of tracking it and like â€˜what is this?â€™. And it was like following, it was like watching us, thatâ€™s what it looked like to us. It seemed like something watching us.â€œFrom what I remember it was like aglow, it was really glowing like a reddish, greenish light. It was really glowing, like something was really hot and it was just glowing.â€ùHe also recalled seeing Colonel Charles Halt there, who made a tape recording describing how beams of light were being shone down by the UFO. He has written an explosive new book called The Halt Perspective describing his close encounter.Mr Longero said: â€œCol Halt came afterwards, after all that was called in. I remember him turning up, thatâ€™s when they kind of gathered everyone around and said this is what we are going to do, and everybody kind of dispersed and did what they were told to do.""I remember we had a little briefing right there and everybody was just like, we just could not believe what we were seeing. Your adrenalin was flowing and I remember people saying like â€˜what is that?â€™.â€ùSTRANGE 'BURNING' OBJECT SPOTTED IN SKY OVER WESTERN USRubbishing theories that the lights in the woods were caused by a lighthouse on the east coast, he laughed: â€œI donâ€™t think so. Not unless the lighthouse could move. Unless they could float that thing in the air.â€œAnd then, as people were getting close to this thing it kind of came nearer to us and then it would go forward and then go back and all of a sudden it just disappeared, like something out of Star Trek, it was like warp speed and we were all â€˜what was that?â€™ it was gone and then thatâ€™s when they started doing all their investigations. After we secured the area they said okay, youâ€™re gone, get out of here.â€ùSteve said he was debriefed a few days later and was told not to talk about what he saw as the base had nuclear weapons on site.UFO investigator Philip Mantle, who interviewed Steve for Outer Limits Magazine, said: â€œSteve does not claim to be anything special but he wanted to emphasise that there were a lot of others involved who were witness to the events in question, many of whom have yet to add their voice to these events.â€œSteve has confirmed the open secret that nuclear weapons were stored at RAF Bentwaters at the time although he did not personally witness any lights being shone onto the WSA.UFO OVER ST. LOUIS? STRANGE LIGHT OVER GATEWAY ARCH SPARKS DEBATEâ€œHe has confirmed much of what Colonel Halt has already said on the record and he is in no doubt that Larry Warren was there.â€œWhat is clear is that despite the best efforts of some this case will continue to be hotly debated for many years to come.â€ùThe story originally appeared on The Sun."foxnews,Fans furious with Nicki Minaj for making fun of mentally ill woman,"Nicki Minaj infuriated fans and mental health advocates when she posted a video mocking a Miami woman to Instagram.In the clip, posted Monday with a laughing emoji, Minaj, 33, engages with a woman who shouts into the rapperâ€™s car.â€œWhat you said? Miss? Câ€™mere,â€ù the â€œPinkprintâ€ù MC says before busting out laughing and asking, â€œWhat did I do? Can we talk?â€ùCommenters didnâ€™t take kindly to the post, with many locals indicating that the woman featured in the clip is mentally ill. One wrote, â€œI live in south beach and i know every homeless [person] around.

Use your platform to encourage kindness.â€ùA rep for National Alliance of Mental Illness-Miami told Page Six, â€œWhether or not the woman in the video has a mental illness or other disability, Nicki Minajâ€™s unfortunate exchange with the elderly woman illustrates the importance for everyone to understand the nature of mental illness and its symptoms and the need for compassionate treatment.â€ùNAMI-Miami added, â€œOne in five people in the United States will suffer from a mental illness at least once in their lifetime. That means anyone can be affected by it, even celebrities. Celebrities should use their influence among young people in a positive manner to bring awareness to the real issues surrounding mental illness. Nobody would make fun of a cancer patient, and mental illness is an illness like any other.

It's adding all-wheel drive.It's a new feature for Detroit's pony cars â€“ none of the three have ever had it â€“ and it could be a game-changer. Called the Challenger GT, the Dodge launches this winter for a starting price of $34,490.The Challenger GT comes with the Pentastar 3.6-liter V6 rated at 305 horsepower and 268 pound-feet of torque. It teams with an eight-speed TorqueFlight automatic transmission and is estimated to get 18 miles per gallon in the city and 27 mpg on the highway. An FCA spokesperson said no manual transmission or V8 models will be offered on the all-wheel-drive Challenger. It will be on display in January at the Detroit auto show.All-wheel drive is a widely expected addition for the Challenger. The coupe shares underpinnings with the four-door Charger, which offers an all-wheel drive variant and the cars have similar powertrain offerings (the AWD Charger is also V6 and automatic only). Naturally, the Challenger borrows the Charger's AWD system and during regular driving conditions, the front axle disengages and full torque goes to the back wheels, allowing the Challenger to function as a rear-wheel drive car. It automatically goes back to AWD when more traction is needed. Handling is also fortified with a vehicle dynamic control system. Conversely, the electronic stability control has three modes and can be switched off for drift-happy enthusiasts.The GT has features familiar to other Challenger and Dodge owners, including an 8.4-inch touchscreen radio, Performance Pages (accessible through the Super Trak Pack button), and paddle shifters. A Sport Mode changes shift points to improve acceleration. It all rolls on 19-inch wheels wrapped in all-season rubber. The exterior gets a hood bulge, LED head- and taillights, and a decklid spoiler.The Challenger GT also offers a $995-interior package different than RWD models, adding Nappa leather, Alcantara suede seats, a nine-speaker Alpine audio system, performance steering wheel, and more.All of that is just window dressing. It's all-wheel drive that could be a difference-maker for consumers. The Challenger won't likely be able to take down the Mustang, which will finish 2016 as the pony car sales king. It's moved 98,868 units through November, well ahead of the second-place Camaro's 65,705 sales. The Challenger is right behind the Chevy, with 59,176. All-wheel drive might be enough to edge it ahead of the Bow-Tie bruiser in '17, upending the traditional pecking order. The Motor City muscle coupe wars just escalated.

Sugar-sweetened beverages are also linked to rising rates of heart disease and diabetes.In a survey of 19,000 adults, the poor sleepers consumed 21 percent more sugar sweetened drinks than adults who got a healthy seven to eight hours per night. The main association was caffeinated non-diet sodas.Whatâ€™s more, is that compared to heavier sleepers, those who reported no more than five hours of shut eye were more likely to smoke or be sedentary. They were also more likely to have chronic health issues.For more on this story, check FOXNewsHealth.com.Housecall for Health, Iâ€™m Alex Hein, FOX News.Follow Alex Hein on Twitter: @ Ahlex3889"foxnews,JetBlue treats dozens of sick children to 'Dream Flight',"Dozens of children and their families took to the skies Tuesday in a special flight over Vermont to help them kick off the holiday season and forget about their illnesses for the day.

The inscriptions also warn would-be counterfeiters that they face the penalty of death by beheading.The 645-year-old banknote was found hidden inside a wooden sculpture of the head of a ""luohan,"" a religious figure from Chinese Buddhism, that may once have stood in a family or public temple, said Paul Sumner, chief executive of Mossgreen's Auctions in Melbourne, Australia, which discovered the note. [See photos of the paper banknote that dates back to China's Ming Dynasty]Sumner said the firm's specialist in Asian artworks, Ray Tregaskis, spotted the note wedged inside the hollow head of the sculpture as he inspected the artifact in preparation for an auction in Sydney, Australia, next month.""It wasn't easy to see â€” it was hidden right up out of eyesight, folded up into a little, 1-inch fold,"" Sumner told Live Science. ""The note has been in at least two collections that we know of without the knowledge of the owners.""Currency experts at Mossgreen's Auctions immediately identified the note as a rare paper ""bank seal"" that was issued in China during the Ming Dynasty.""It wasn't in very good condition, as you'd imagine with all those folds and after hundreds of years with some degree of exposure to the elements,"" Sumner said.Very few of these Ming Dynasty banknotes have survived to present day, he added, ""bearing in mind that they were constantly being handled â€” it's not like people kept them in plastic sleeves, like collectors would today.""Ming moneyThe Ming Dynasty banknote is much larger than modern paper money, roughly equivalent to the size of a standard ""U.S. letter"" page of paper.Chinese characters and official seals printed in red and black ink declare that the note is a ""Great Ming Treasure Note"" with a value of ""one guan"" â€” depicted as 10 ""strings"" of Chinese copper coins, which could be grouped with a string through the hole in each coin.According to the American historian of Chinese currency John E. Sandrock , one guan was equivalent to 1,000 copper coins, or 1 ounce of pure silver.The newfound banknote also includes a dire warning to counterfeiters that they will be punished with decapitation, and offers a large reward to anyone who informs on such criminals.At the time this banknote was issued, paper money was almost unheard of outside China. The first European banknotes date from the mid-17th century, around 300 years later. [The 25 Most Mysterious Archaeological Finds on Earth]Based on the date on the banknote and the expert dating of the sculpture it was found in, it's thought the money may have been hidden as a religious offering when the sculpture was already 30 to 50 years old, Sumner said.Small offerings like inscriptions on paper, rice grains and semiprecious stones are often found sealed inside the bases of antique Chinese figurines, he said. However, a high-value banknote is considered an extraordinary find, he said.""From our point of view, what makes the banknote important is that the dating is very close to the dating we'd assumed from stylistic details about the [louhan] figure, as well as the intrigue factor of finding it,"" Sumner said.Long journeySumner said the sculpture that held the hidden banknote was purchased by the Australian art collector Raphy Star from a specialist dealer in the United Kingdom, but nothing is known about the artifact's origins in China.""These figures were created for veneration and for spiritual use, sometimes in temples and sometimes in homes,"" Sumner said. ""It may have been part of a larger figure, and because of its size, [we can conclude that] it probably stood in a temple.""The long journey of the sculpture and its hidden banknote may not be over yet: Both artifacts are up for auction in Sydney on Dec. 11, along with the rest of the Raphy Star collection , and are likely to return to China, Sumner said.""The Chinese have been major buyers for a long time now, and have been repatriating important pieces back to China â€” particularly mainland China,"" he said.The entire Raphy Star collection of artworks from China, Japan and Southeast Asia could fetch up to 5 million Australian dollars ($3.7 million U.S.) at auction, Sumner said.The louhan sculpture and banknote will be sold together, as a single lot, with an estimated value of up to 45,000 Australian dollars ($34,000 U.S.).""It's not that we were worried about being beheaded ourselves, but we just thought it might have been more auspicious to keep the two together,"" Sumner said. ""It's such a great story that we didn't really want to separate them.""Original article on Live Science ."foxnews,'Jeopardy!' contestant dies of cancer week before episode airs,"A â€œJeopardy!â€ù episode airing next week has taken an emotional turn after one of its contestants, Cindy Stowell, died of cancer at the age of 41 on Monday.Stowell, a science-content developer from Austin, Texas, taped the quiz show back in August, and the episode is set to premiere on Dec. 13, a â€œJeopardy!â€ù spokesperson confirmed. This marks the first posthumous airing of a contestantâ€™s appearance.â€œWhen Cindy Stowell taped her appearance on â€˜Jeopardy!,â€™ she had Stage IV cancer. Competing on â€˜Jeopardy!â€™ was a lifelong dream for Cindy, and weâ€™re glad she was able to do so,â€ù said host Alex Trebek in a statement provided to The Post. â€œSadly, Cindy died on Dec. 5. All of us at â€˜Jeopardy!â€™ offer our condolences and best wishes to her family and friends.â€ùHer death and forthcoming â€œJeopardy!â€ù appearance was first announced on Twitter by her longtime boyfriend Jason Hess, who posted that â€œShe was fighting a high-grade fever (which turned out to be a blood infection) and was on painkillers while taping.â€ù Stowell competed with the goal of donating her prize winnings to cancer-related organizations.â€œCindy came on â€˜Jeopardy!â€™ to play the game she loved and in doing so, she was able to make a contribution to cancer research in the hopes that no one else would have to go through what she did,â€ù said Hess and her parents, Greg and Carole Stowell, in a joint statement.Only Trebek and a select group of staffers knew that she was sick. Stowell, who had a Ph.D. in chemical engineering, first passed the online audition test in early 2016, and received an invitation to an in-person audition in Oklahoma City this past summer. She was able to tape three weeks after qualifying, when she informed a show producer that she had recently been told by her doctor that she had about six months to live.Click for more from The New York Post"foxnews,Wildlife officials: Video captures possible 2nd jaguar in US,"A second wild jaguar may have been spotted in the United States.A photo taken Dec. 1 in a southern Arizona mountain range appears to show a new wild jaguar â€” an animal rarely seen in the country after its habitat was lost.The Arizona Game and Fish Department says a preliminary analysis suggests the cat is new to the area and not ""El Jefe,"" a jaguar that was captured on video in a nearby mountain range last year.Until now, El Jefe was believed to be the only jaguar in the U.S., although he hasn't been seen in over a year.The jaguar in question was seen on a camera belonging to Fort Huachuca, the Army installation about 75 miles southeast of Tucson. The military shared the photo with wildlife officials including Game and Fish and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.Mark Hart, a spokesman for the Arizona Game and Fish Department, said jaguars migrate from Mexico to southern Arizona about every five to 10 years but that a female jaguar hasn't been spotted in the U.S. since the 1940s.""So the quality of life isn't here for the jaguar,"" Hart said.But Arizona, New Mexico and other parts of the Southwest were home to jaguars before habitat loss and predator control programs aimed at protecting livestock eliminated them over the last 150 years. A hunter shot and killed the last verified female jaguar in the U.S. in 1963 in northern Arizona.""It's so exciting that in the last 30 years or so, five or six males have shown up in the U.S. and are starting to re-establish themselves in the historical range,"" said Rob Peters, a biologist with Defenders of Wildlife who is based in Tucson.

There were females and cubs in the Southwest,"" Peters said.But protecting the big cats has been fraught with legal challenges.In March 2014, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service set aside nearly 1,200 square miles along the U.S.-Mexico border as habitat essential for the conservation of the jaguar. The New Mexico Farm and Livestock Bureau, New Mexico Cattle Growers' Association and New Mexico Federal Lands Council filed a lawsuit nearly a year later, saying the decision was ""unlawful, arbitrary and capricious"" action by federal authorities. That lawsuit is ongoing.Only El Jefe has made numerous appearances in the U.S. in several years.

Do you find a helping of fresh grated Parmesan to be irresistable? Well, thereâ€™s good news for you, a recent study published in the Journal Nature Medicine reported that eating cheese, specifically the aged kind containing the compound spermidine, was linked to a longer life in mammals.The study focused on 800 Italians and found that those who had more cheese had lower blood pressure, a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and 40 percent lower risk of heart failure. Diets often include cheese to promote heart benefits as well as anti-hypertension properties.But before you reach for the cheese whiz, keep in mind eating everything in moderation is more beneficial than overdoing it.Thereâ€™s also been a study linking an intake of cheese to a heightened risk of breast cancer, lympoid cancers and lung cancer.For more on this story, check FOXNewsHealth.com.Housecall for Health, Iâ€™m Alex Hein, FOX News.Follow Alex Hein on Twitter: @ Ahlex3889"foxnews,"Coming up on Thursday, Dec 8 edition of 'Special Report'",foxnews,"Glencore, Qatari fund buy 19.5 percent in Russia's Rosneft","The Kremlin says that a consortium of Glencore and Qatar's sovereign wealth fund has acquired a 19.5-percent stake in Russia's top state-controlled oil company, Rosneft, in a deal worth 10.5 billion euros ($11.3 billion).Continue Reading BelowThe sale is part of the Russian government's efforts to privatize some state assets to help balance the budget amid a two-year recession.President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, on Wednesday described the deal as the largest in the global energy market this year.He told reporters that Putin congratulated Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin on the deal and ordered Rosneft to work together with the Finance Ministry and the Central Bank to prevent the deal from destabilizing Russia's currency markets."foxnews,Is it healthier to shampoo less?,foxnews,Hebrew may be world's oldest alphabet,"The oldest recorded alphabet may be Hebrew. According to a controversial new study by archaeologist and ancient inscription specialist Douglas Petrovich, Israelites in Egypt took 22 ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs and turned them into the Hebrew alphabet over 3,800 years ago.The discovery of this early Hebrew alphabet has proved controversial to scholars who dispute the dates Petrovich has for the Israelitesâ€™ stay in Egypt â€“ 430 years to the very day, as recorded in Exodus 12:40-41, equaling 1876-1446 BC â€“ arguing that Biblical dates are unreliable. Skeptics have also disputed the Hebrew identification, arguing the early alphabet could be any number of Semitic languages.The road to Petrovichâ€™s discovery started back in 2012, when he was researching hieroglyphic inscriptions online from an Egyptian stone slab dated 1842 B.C. The slab, known as Sinai 115, identified Joseph and his sons Ephraim and Manassehâ€“ all figures from the Hebrew Bible, the latter of whom inscribed the hieroglyphs on the slab himself. Something in the text Manasseh wroteâ€“ translation â€œ6 Levantines: Hebrews of Bethel, the beloved,â€ù which referred to himself, his son, and four other Hebrews on a turquoise mining expeditionâ€“ caught the eye of Petrovich. It was the worldâ€™s oldest letter, he says.STAR OF BETHLEHEM MAY NOT HAVE BEEN A STAR AFTER ALL, SCIENTIST SAYSâ€œOn this otherwise Middle Egyptian caption were a Canaanite syllabic and the worldâ€™s oldest attested proto-consonantal letterâ€“â€˜Bâ€™, depicting a house for the Hebrew consonant bayit,â€ù Petrovich told Foxnews.com. â€œIt was this single proto-consonantal Hebrew letter that helped me to understand that the worldâ€™s oldest alphabet, the language of which has been unidentified for over 150 years of scholarship, is Hebrew.â€ùRelated Image Expand / Contract Petrovich's electronic drawing of Sinai 375a, which includes the separation of words and identification of proto-consonantal letters with biblical/modern Hebrew letters next to them (Credit: Douglas Petrovich).Petrovich, who currently teaches Ancient Egypt at Wilfred Laurier University, isnâ€™t the first to identify Hebrew as the language of the worldâ€™s oldest alphabet. Back in the 1920â€™s, a German scholar named Hubert Grimme identified some of the inscriptions as Hebrew. However, unlike Petrovich, he was unable to identify all of the letters in the alphabet correctly. This led to failed translations and rejection by other scholars.Putting together a complete alphabet, detailed in a soonâ€“toâ€“beâ€“released book by Petrovich, was no easy task.â€œI was translating Middle Egyptian and proto-consonantal Hebrew inscriptions that nobody ever had translated successfully before,â€ù he said. â€œThere were many â€˜A-ha!â€™ moments along the way, because I was stumbling across biblical figures never attested before in the epigraphical record, or seeing connections that I had not understood before.â€ùARCHAEOLOGISTS UNCOVER 'LOST CITY' IN EGYPTDividing words properly was also a hurdle because the letters all run together, without any spaces between them or punctuation.Related Image Expand / Contract Petrovich's electronic drawing of Sinai 351, a stone slab from Egypt, which describes how the Nile River had swollen to over twice its normal level after the year had changed, a catastrophic event that caused cultic shrines and watering troughs to become unclean due to contamination from silty river water (Credit: Douglas Petrovich).After finally completing the alphabet, Petrovich was able to translate 16 Hebrew inscriptions from four different sites in Egypt and Sinai. In these inscriptions he found a number of distinctly Hebrew words, including the naming of 3 biblical figures: Asenath (the wife of Joseph), Ahisamach (the father of Oholiab, who was appointed to build the tabernacle in the desert), and Moses, who was credited by the Hebrew Bible as being the man who led the Israelites out of Egypt.â€œI absolutely was surprised to find [the reference to] Moses, because he resided in Egypt for less than a year at the time of his provoking of astonishment there,â€ù Petrovich recalled. â€œIn fact, the Hebrew letters â€˜M-Shâ€™ could have other meanings, and I had to examine every other possibility for those uses of Hebrew words with those letters. Only after realizing that every other possibility had to be eliminated, whether due to contextual or grammatical limitations, was I forced to admit that this word must be taken as a proper noun, and almost undoubtedly refers to the Moses who is credited with writing the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, known as the Torah.â€ùThe inscription with the Moses reference dates back to 1446 or 1447 B.C.â€“ the final year of the Israelitesâ€™ stay in Egyptâ€“ and describes events written about in Exodus 1, such as the enslavement of Hebrews. In the inscription, Moses is depicted as a man who inspired awe in the Hebrew community, which would match well with the biblical events describing Mosesâ€™ encounters with the pharaoh.EARLIEST-KNOWN TEN COMMANDMENTS TABLET SELLS AT AUCTION FOR $850,000Petrovich hopes that skeptics, instead of coming to preâ€“conclusions about his claims, will study his new findings with an open mind and be objective.â€œMy discoveries are so controversial because if correct, they will rewrite the history books and undermine much of the assumptions and misconceptions about the ancient Hebrew people and the Bible that have become commonly accepted in the scholarly world and taught as factual in the worldâ€™s leading universities,â€ù he said. â€œTo my skeptics, I say, â€˜Continue to be skeptical. Do not accept my conclusions until you are convinced they are correct.â€™ Truth is unâ€“killable, so if I am correct, my findings will outlast scholarly scrutiny.â€ùFurther details can be found in Petrovichâ€™s book â€œThe Worldâ€™s Oldest Alphabetâ€ù (Carta Books), which will be available in the coming weeks."foxnews,Ancient plants in Israel give clues about real 'Paleo' diet,"Mom was right: Eat your vegetables. We were born to be herbivores.Researchers in Israel have discovered the remains of 780,000-year-old edible plants that reveal the plant-based diet of the earliest humans, according to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.The more than 9,000 plant remains were discovered on the shoreline of Lake Hula, in the northern Jordan Valley. They date back to the Acheulian culture of 1.75-0.25 million years ago.Now theyâ€™re giving scientists an opportunity to study the plant-based diet of prehistoric humans from the Pleistocene age.The remains of the plants, many of which are considered extinct, were found during an archaeological excavation at Gesher Benot Ya'aqov. The damp conditions and lack of oxygen at the waterlogged site under the Jordan River and Lake Hula preserved the plant remains for hundreds of millennia.RARE, GOLD ROMAN COIN DISCOVERED IN JERUSALEM""This region is known for the wealth of plants, but what surprised us were the sources of plant food coming from the lake,â€ù Dr. Yoel Melamed of the Faculty of Life Sciences at Bar Ilan University, said in a statement. â€œWe found more than 10 species that existed here in prehistoric times but no longer today, such as two types of water nuts, from which seven were edible.""Among the remains were 55 species of edible plants, including seeds, fruits, nuts, leaves, stems, roots and tubers.""In recent years,â€ù said Naama Goren-Inbar, a professor at the Institute of Archeology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, â€œwe were met with a golden opportunity to reveal numerous remains of fruits, nuts and seeds from trees, shrubs and the lake, alongside the remains of animals and human-made stone tools in one locality.""Gesher Benot Ya'aqov is also where Goren-Inbar found the earliest evidence of the use of fire in Eurasia.""The use of fire is very important because a lot of the plants are toxic or inedible,â€ù Goren-Inbar said in the statement. â€œUsing fire, like roasting nuts and roots for example, allows the use of various parts of the plant and increases the diversity of the plant component of the Acheulian diet, alongside aquatic and terrestrial fauna."""foxnews,Report of missing data in election-related incident survey,foxnews,Trial of accused Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof begins,"Dylann Roof sat quietly as the lead prosecutor in his death penalty trial described Wednesday how he allegedly opened fire on a dozen members of a Charleston church who had welcomed him to a bible study.â€œHe seemed to the 12 to be harmless,â€ù prosecutor Jay Richardson said during his opening statement. â€œBut little did they know what a cold and hateful heart he had.â€ùMISTRIAL DECLARED IN NORTH CHARLESTON POLICE SHOOTING CASERoofâ€™s lawyer David Bruck, a renowned opponent of the death penalty, told jurors he expects a guilty verdict. But he urged jurors to consider Roofâ€™s background and motivations when they decide whether he should be sentenced to prison for the rest of his life or whether he should be executed.The large group of observers in the packed courtroom included family members of the nine victims who died in the massacre at the historically black Emanuel AME Church the evening of June 17, 2015.TWO GEORGIA POLICE OFFICERS SHOT NEAR COLLEGERoof, an avowed white supremacist, had initially said he wanted to act as his own attorney. He has since agreed to allow lawyers to represent him in the initial guilt phase of the trial, but not in the sentencing phase. Under this arrangement, Roof himself would have the option to cross-examine witnesses during this later phase â€” including victimsâ€™ relatives.â€œNormally youâ€™d have a defense attorney asking the questions and the defendant sitting at the defense table,â€ù said Ashleigh Merchant, an Atlanta-based criminal defense attorney. â€œBut not in this situation. Youâ€™d actually have him speaking directly to the victim. And that very well may be the answer as to why he wants to represent himself.â€ùBut Merchant said there are other reasons clients refuse legal representation during sentencing â€” including a desire to prevent their lawyers from bringing up information about their past. Such information may play on jurorsâ€™ sympathies, but can be embarrassing for a defendant.â€œIâ€™ve had that in my own practice, where my client suffered great abuse during his childhood or suffers from mental illness,â€ù Merchant said. â€œAnd the reasons that he did this crime, he just does not want to come out in public.â€ùThe beginning of the Roof trial comes just two days after another racially-charged case ended in a mistrial in a courthouse across the street. A jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict on whether Michael Slager, a white North Charleston Police officer, committed a crime when he fatally shot Walter Scott, an African-American motorist who fled on foot during a routine traffic stop last year.Roofâ€™s defense team requested a delay in jury selection and opening statements, arguing that publicity surrounding the other trial might influence jurors in their case. But U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel denied the motion and the trial began on schedule.Jonathan Serrie joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in April 1999 and currently serves as a correspondent based in the Atlanta bureau."foxnews,How do you know if a concert venue is safe?,"The deaths of at least 36 concertgoers in an Oakland warehouse inferno last Friday have many wondering if there is any way to know if a concert venue â€“ especially a non-traditional space -- is safe.Paul Wertheimer, head of Los Angeles' Crowd Management Strategies, said no one can ever really know for sure.â€œWe assume venues are safe,â€ù Wertheimer told FOX411. â€œWe find out too late they are notâ€_ There are too often few and fleeting options of escape. Getting on your knees and heading for the exit -- if there is one visible and unlocked -- is good advice for the first 10 people. After that, survivability diminishes.â€ùOfficials said the Ghost Ship Warehouse had no fire sprinklers or smoke detectors and the only way out was on the first floor through a dark, rickety stairway.Wertheimer said concerts like the one at the Ghost Ship are illegal and leave no room for safety.â€œThey are not safe in any way,â€ù he said. â€œUnsafe venue, no crowd management plan, no emergency plan, no trained crowd managers, no capacity limitation.â€ùSteve Adelman, Vice President of the Event Safety Alliance, said people need to be as aware as they possibly can when they go to any sort of entertainment space.â€œThe thing that people should look for when they go into any live event space â€_ is clearly marked exits over a door which is accessible to them,â€ù he explained. â€œAnybody at this point knows what an exit sign is supposed to look likeâ€_that is not a hard thing to ask people to look for. That exit sign has to be over a door which is accessible to them.â€ùBut most people do not necessarily asses the risks a venue might have before going, and evacuation plans are not something that crosses their mind until there is an emergency.â€œThe whole idea of going to a show, a club, or sporting event itâ€™s a place where other people have already taken care of safety measures,â€ù Adelman said. â€œI think most of the time when someone goes out for entertainment purposes, they are kind of suspending their disbelief about the need to protect themselves because they trust someone already looked into this.â€ùThe Ghost Ship warehouse manager Derick Ion Almena apologized for the tragedy on â€œTodayâ€ù Tuesday morning.â€œItâ€™s not a good morning. What am I doing here? Can I just say Iâ€™m sorry?â€ù he said. â€œThe only reason why Iâ€™m here is to put my face and my body here in front. Am I the man who should be held accountable? Did I build something â€_ I mean what am I going to say to that? Should I be held accountable? I can barely stand here right now.â€ùWertheimer said the real problem is deficiencies in crowd safety laws.â€œThe scandal is a lack of comprehensive crowd safety laws and the failure of public officials to enforce those that exist,â€ù he said. â€œThe other problem is compliance...The first responders did a heroic job in Oakland. But, what about the fire inspectors, police and city that could have prevented---or attempted to prevent this known illegal situation?â€ùEarlier this week, the Los Angeles County Fire Department issued tips for what you should do before enterting an entertainment venue.1. Take a good look around at the condition of the building.2. Have a communication plan and plan a meeting place.3. When you enter the building locate exits immediately and check for clear exit paths.4. If there is an emergency, react immediately, get out and stay out.A refrigerator may have been the cause of the Oakland warehouse inferno. Alameda County Sheriff Greg Ahern said a person who escaped the deadly blaze told authorities there were flames coming from the refrigerator, and evidence found at the scene so far supports the claim.The buildingâ€™s structure and safety have reportedly been on city officialsâ€™ radar for some time and questions have emerged about whether more could have been done to prevent the fire.Oakland planning officials opened an investigation last month after repeated complaints about the warehouse. An inspector who went to the premises couldn't get inside, said Darin Ranelletti of the Oakland Planning Department.Once the building is cleared, the investigation will turn to the cause of the fire. The district attorney warned of possible murder charges as she determines whether there were any crimes linked to the blaze.The Ghost Ship fire is just the latest fire-related concert tragedy. In 2003, there was a fire caused by pyrotechnics at the Station Nightclub in Rhode Island, killing 100 people. In 2013, there was a nightclub fire in Brazil that left 238 people dead.The AP contributed to this report.You can follow Blanche Johnson on Twitter @blancheFOXLA."foxnews,Trump marginalizes D.C. transition staff,"While Donald Trump dines on frog legs with Mitt Romney and meets with a parade of lawmakers and governors in his gold-plated Midtown skyscraper, most of his transition staff are hunkered down in Washington, D.C., writing detailed governing plans for his first 100 days.But so far, Trump and his inner circle have largely ignored those plans as they focus on top appointments and lean on the advice of politicians, CEOs and donors, rather than on their transition staff, say sources close to the transition.Story Continued BelowThe president-elect, meanwhile, has been more likely to set policy on Twitter than through consultation with his D.C. advisers.â€œThe senior people are all focused on Cabinet appointments,â€ù said a Republican official involved in past transitions. â€œI wonder how much time, attention and decision-making is being allocated to the rest of the government. â€_ It is not a recipe for smooth governance.""The New York-D.C. transition divide reflects Trumpâ€™s tendency to focus on personnel and, especially, personality, over policy. Experts say that bent, combined with his improvisational style and the divisions between the teams will complicate his transition to the White House, making it less likely heâ€™ll have a cohesive roadmap for governing on Day One.Lisa Brown, a former top official for the Obama-Biden transition, warns that failing to engage on policy could hamper his administration's governing efforts.â€œIt is hard to get the government to do things. Itâ€™s not like you flip a switch,â€ù she said. â€œEven reversing regulations, as Trump has said he wants to do, is a long process.â€ùIndeed, some Obama administration officials worry the Trump transition is far behind in coming up with department-by-department transition plans. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, for example, told reporters on Monday that her agency has had only one visit from one person from the transition team.A Trump transition official disputed any divide between New York and D.C., or that the transition is falling behind, saying the senior team is â€œproviding clear guidance for New York and D.C. every single day. â€_ The operations are seamless and working well.â€ùTo be sure, past transitions have also suffered from geographic divides. Barack Obama spent much of his time in Chicago ahead of his inauguration and Hillary Clintonâ€™s close aides were also largely based in New York City. The influence of lower-level transition policy staff has always paled in comparison to those aides who have the president-electâ€™s ear.â€œAny transition team only has the power to make recommendations, unless someone on that team ends up in the government,â€ù says Charlie Black, a long-time GOP operative and lobbyist, who is not working for the Trump transition.But former transition officials say Trumpâ€™s operation is unusual in the way itâ€™s leaving so much of the policy and second-tier personnel appointments to D.C. transition team members, many of whom are volunteers with little power and no connection to Trumpâ€™s key advisers.On the Obama transition team, for instance, John Podesta ran interference between the president-elect and the massive D.C. transition operation and kept a tight rein over it. While Vice President-elect Mike Pence is technically doing this job, heâ€™s also the governor of Indiana and vice president-elect, responsible for advising on Cabinet picks and reaching out to Capitol Hill.â€œPersonnel is so important in this administration because they donâ€™t have a clear roadmap for policy,â€ù said a Republican official involved in past transitions. â€œWhoever they pick at Education or as the domestic policy chief will be writing a lot of it.â€ùThat official noted that if they had, say, a well-defined tax plan, parts of it would already have been shared with the Joint Tax Committee or Congressional Budget Office to see how much revenue would really be lost. â€œFor this gang, I donâ€™t think this stuff matters very much,â€ù he said.People close to Trump say they expect him to rely heavily on Pence and other policy staffers once he enters the White House, freeing up Trump to stake out a broader strategic and political vision.""I donâ€™t necessarily think heâ€™s saying, 'Boy, Iâ€™d really like to breathlessly wait for the Ways and Means subcommittee to put out the first draft of the tax reform bill,â€™"" said one person close to Trump's transition team.Trump has few real ties to Washingtonâ€™s network of Republican policy wonks and is much more likely to take advice from son-in-law Jared Kushner and Steve Bannon, Trumpâ€™s incoming chief strategist, than from veterans of Republican presidencies.â€œThere is an expectation that Trump will adjust to Washington, but I keep telling people that Washington needs to adjust to him,â€ù says a lobbyist close to the transition. â€œThere is less influence from Washington than there is from the orbits directly around him.â€ùStill, it is the D.C. transition staff that will build the bridge between the Obama and Trump administrations. It is assembling the all-important â€œbeachheadâ€ù teams that will enter federal agencies on Jan. 20 and run things for several months if need be while Trumpâ€™s nominees are awaiting Senate confirmation. The teams will consist of appointees who donâ€™t require confirmation, like chiefs of staff, who will work with existing career employees to ensure a seamless transition, two people familiar with Trumpâ€™s transition told POLITICO.Right now, though, the only access the D.C. staff has to Trumpâ€™s inner circle is through Pence and his top aides, creating a â€œbottleneckâ€ù of information, says one lobbyist with transition ties. â€œEveryone is inundating him and his people with their content. He only has so many asks himself.â€ùOne D.C.-based transition staffer said he gets most of his information about whatâ€™s happening with the transition from watching the comings and goings at Trump Tower on the news. â€œItâ€™s pretty secretive,â€ù the person said. â€œWhat you all know is about what I know. All the work thatâ€™s being done on personnel is literally being done out of New York, not here.â€ùRick Dearborn â€” a former aide to Jeff Sessions â€” is running the transition day-to-day, but he is not a part of Trumpâ€™s core inner circle, which besides Kushner, Bannon and Pence includes Reince Priebus, Trumpâ€™s incoming chief of staff, and Kellyanne Conway, his campaign manager and pollster.Dearborn did not respond to an interview request. A transition official would not comment on whether Dearborn spends the majority of his time in New York at Trump Tower or D.C.Much of the big-picture policy work for the first 100 days is being led by a former aide to Sessions (R-Ala.), Stephen Miller, who splits his time between New York and D.C., according to a transition official.Transition staff told POLITICO that communication between New York and D.C. is improving now that Pence has assumed control. Pence has made regular visits and calls to the D.C. office, and he is likely to take a leading policy role in the administration.But as the transition team grows in size, itâ€™s becoming harder for policy experts to get the attention of Trumpâ€™s inner-circle. Recently, the transition team has added a new layer of top advisers â€” more than a dozen business executives â€” putting even greater distance between the president-electâ€™s top advisers and the people making the majority of the policy suggestions.â€œThe executive team is doing high-profile vetting, recommendations and recruitment,â€ù said Rep. Devin Nunes, part of the transitionâ€™s so-called executive committee. â€œTheyâ€™re not asking what our policy is going to be on X, Y, or Z.â€ùMultiple people close to the transition said the best way to influence Trumpâ€™s policies is to talk to his core advisers in New York. â€œNew York is the fun and the TV cameras, and D.C. is the people who are going into the Pentagon and Labor and Interior. It is not the glamorous end of the stick,â€ù a GOP strategist added.Transition staff in D.C., many of whom are well-respected in their fields and have direct experience working in federal agencies, have been told not to expect jobs in the Trump administration. Two sources, one inside the transition and one close to it, told POLITICO that transition leaders have said that members of the agency landing teams will not be tapped for Senate-confirmed jobs â€” an edict that immediately relegates them to those with less pull and stature.One transition official said she was not aware of any such policy and that most of the landing team members are volunteers, adding that â€œevery citizen is allowed to apply for these jobs.""In another sign of the D.C. teamâ€™s lesser influence, one Republican lobbyist said he declined to give up his clients and join the transition team because the D.C.-based staff have so little control over Trumpâ€™s agenda.The D.C.-based transition operation has several teams preparing for the hand-off of power, and the heads of all of these teams talk on a daily phone call, a transition official said.Policy implementation teams are focused on broad policy themes like immigration, energy and health care. Agency-action teams are focused on charting out an agenda for dozens of federal agencies.And the landing teams, a sub-group of the agency-action teams, are tasked with going into federal agencies and figuring out the logistics of the transition from inside the government.But little coordination is occurring between the so-called landing teams that go into federal agencies on behalf of Trump and his multiple layers of top advisers. â€œItâ€™s not clear how much synergy the landing teams have with the folks who will actually be taking in these Cabinet positions,â€ù said one source whoâ€™s met with transition officials multiple times.â€œIf I am on the Treasury landing team, and Iâ€™ve never met Steve Mnuchin, how much sway am I going to have?â€ù"foxnews,Dems demand briefings on whether Russia titled election,foxnews,Miller Time: 'Consequences' for companies leaving US,foxnews,Shepard Smith Salutes His Father and the Greatest Generation in Touching Tribute,"This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Back in the middle of the 19th century, when pioneers first arrived in the area, the lake spread across roughly 1,600 square miles. Now, the lake covers an area of only about 1,050 square miles, new satellite photos from NASA reveal. In October, the Great Salt Lake reached its lowest level in recorded history, at 4,191 feet deep.These dramatic declines in water levels come from years of human activity â€” namely, diverting river water, which would normally fill the lake, for agriculture and industry, according to NASA. The agency estimates that about 40 percent of the river's water is diverted from the lake. These activities, along with the ongoing drought in the West, have drained the historic lake. [Gallery: Rainbow of Life in Great Salt Lake]The NASA images show changes in the Farmington Bay basin of Great Salt Lake, an area that is home to many diverse wildlife, including migratory birds. Decreasing water levels in the Bay not only affect the ecology of the area, but could divert the bird populations who migrate to the basin for food.""Farmington Bay has been nearly desiccated as the result of the combined effects of drought and water withdrawals from the rivers feeding the lake,"" Wayne Wurtsbaugh, a watershed sciences researcher at Utah State University, said in a statement. ""Farmington Bay is an immensely important feeding area for migratory shorebirds and waterfowl. Even at the low level we have now, it is still important, but the greatly reduced size has diminished its value.""The NASA satellite images show changes in the Farmington Bay basin from 2011 to 2016. Scientists estimate that more than three-quarters of the lake bed is now exposed in the bay, significantly diminishing the food available for wildlife.In February, Wurtsbaugh and his colleagues released a white paper on how water development has impacted the Great Salt Lake. Their study found that river flow into the basin has been reduced by 39 percent since the middle of the 19th century. Reversing this trend would involve more conservation efforts, especially for agricultural irrigation, which accounts for approximately 63 percent of water usage in Utah, Wurtsbaugh said.Even with conservation efforts and more ecologically conscious development, the lake could continue to diminish due to climate change , the researchers said.""A wild card for the fate of the lake is what global climate change may do to the basin,â€ù Wurtsbaugh said. ""Warmer air temperatures are projected to lower runoff, but our data shown in the white paper suggests there haven't been climate change effects on the runoff yet.""Original article on Live Science ."foxnews,#mediabuzz with Howard Kurtz Premium Podcast,"#mediabuzz â€“ with Howard Kurtz â€“ analyzes the coverage of a wide range of topics, including technology, social media, politics, culture and sports.

They need answers.""The fire broke out during a dance party Friday night in the cluttered warehouse.The structure had been converted to artists' studios and illegal living spaces, and former denizens said it was a death trap of piled wood, furniture, snaking electrical cords and only two exits.Danielle Boudreaux, a 40-year-old hairdresser who was close with Derick Ion Almena, the founder of the artists' colony, and his partner, Micah Allison, said it was full of extension cords plugged into each other that helped supply power to music equipment, microwaves and hot plates.There were also RVs inside, she said.Almena has not responded to emails or calls by The Associated Press to phone numbers associated with him. He has said he didn't attend the event Friday night, and he is sorry.City and state officials fielded complaints for years about dangerous conditions, drugs, neglected children, trash, thefts and squabbles at the warehouse, raising questions about why it wasn't shut down. The district attorney has warned of possible murder charges as she determines whether there were any crimes linked to the blaze.The fire has cast a spotlight on similar artists' colonies around the San Francisco Bay Area that offer cheap housing in one of the country's priciest rental markets but have raised safety concerns among neighbors and city officials.Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said the city will look to strengthen regulations for smoke alarms and exits and clarify city employees' responsibilities to monitor unsafe structures.She said the city has been flooded with complaints about building safety since the fire and she wants to engage the arts community in the review to ensure any changes don't jeopardize their access to affordable housing and work space.On Wednesday, an Oakland restaurant owner, Dorothy King, called a news conference to say she was concerned the artists' warehouse next to her business could pose a safety hazard.Several artists tried to shout her down, accusing her of launching a ""witch hunt"" that could result in artists' collectives being shut down.King said that wasn't her intention.""I'm concerned about my business burning down. I'm concerned about a tragedy that could happen,"" she said. ""The city should come in and help, not shut it down."""foxnews,"Congressional Clinton probes will go forward post-election, GOP lawmakers say","At least four congressional investigations into Hillary Clintonâ€™s personal email use and mishandling of classified information are expected to go forward even after the former secretary of stateâ€™s election loss last week, Republican lawmakers tell Fox News.The probes, which cover allegations that Clinton lied to Congress about her email practices in October 2015 and that government records were destroyed, are ongoing and not dependent on the election's outcome, two senior Republican senators said.""I still don't have the information I need,"" Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, told Fox News. Johnson said the work of his committee, with jurisdiction over government records and the mishandling of classified information, would be careful not to disrupt President-elect Donald Trumpâ€™s priorities.â€œI think itâ€™s one of the messages of this election that the public is disgusted when they see double standards, when they think people in high places, high government officials can get away with what ordinary citizens can't,â€ù he said. â€œSo, I just think itâ€™s extremely important to follow this thing through and get all the information. Make it public.â€ùA spokesperson for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said answers, not the political calendar, are driving investigators.""Senator Grassley has always followed inquiries through to their logical end, until he feels he's received the answers he needs to be able to satisfy the questions he posed on the public's behalf. He performs oversight regardless of which party holds the White House, just as he initiates oversight inquiries irrespective of politics,"" the spokesperson said.While the senators have more latitude to conduct committee investigations, there is an expectation on the House side that leadership will set immediate priorities for the new session.Both the House judiciary and government oversight committees have pending investigations that cover allegations of a quid pro quo between a State Department executive and an FBI official over stripping an email of its classified status in return for coveted slots for the bureau overseas. Congressional sources said lingering questions about the FBI probe into the Clinton Foundation, and pay-to-play allegations, must also be resolved â€“ though FBI Director James Comey sought to close the book on the email case right before the election, after briefly re-opening the matter.""We still have some questions because [Comeyâ€™s] latest letter narrowed the scope of their investigation to the time that she was secretary of state, but we're also interested in what happened before and what happened after that. It's this huge â€_ mess that has to be cleaned up. So we would be remiss if we just dismiss it and moved on,"" Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, told Fox Newsâ€™ â€œSunday Morning Futures.â€ùCongressional sources said some committee requests for the State Department are over a year old, and others from the FBI, including for a handful of remaining interview summaries known as 302s, have yet to be fulfilled.""[The requests] go back probably about a year. I've asked for information on who else, what other high-level administration officials were engaged on these emails,"" Johnson said.President Obama, among others, used an alias to correspond with Clinton on her personal email which resided on a private, unsecured server.During a weekend conference call with top donors, Hillary Clinton blamed Comey for her defeat. Clinton said Comey's decision to reopen the email case 11 days before the election put her campaign on the defense and blunted her ability to make a strong closing argument.While Comey announced two days before the polls opened that he continued to believe there was no basis for criminal charges, Clinton told donors the FBI director's decision reinforced a central Trump campaign theme -- that the system is rigged -- and it drove Trump voters to the polls on Election Day. On CBSâ€™ â€œThis Morning,â€ù Clintonâ€™s former Democratic primary rival Bernie Sanders said the failure goes beyond the emails.""It's not a question of what happens in the last week,"" Sanders told Charlie Rose. ""The question is she should have won this election by 10 percentage points. The question is why it is millions of white working-class people voted for Obama, turned their backs on the Democratic Party.""Catherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.C.

But Kim feels relieved he is getting the help he needs.

He had way too much on his plate and it came to a point where he couldn't handle it all, so he just broke. He needs to find a good balance with the two in his life and he'll work hard at finding that.""Whilst another insider added: ""Kanye keeps wanting to work. At the hospital, he requested that recording equipment be brought to the hospital so he can record in his bed. And he has kept asking to see sketches of his fashion lines. He continues to want to work and Kim has to keep telling him to rest.""Kim has been married twice before after she eloped with music producer Damon Thomas in 2000 at the age of 19.However, the marriage was over two years later and Thomas filed for divorce. Kim went on to claim the pair separated due to emotional and physical abuse in the relationship.Kim then married basketball star Kris Humphries in August 2011 but the marriage famously last for only 72 days.This article originally appeared in The Sun."foxnews,Breakdown,"Andyâ€™s out, but youâ€™re in for a treat with this weekâ€™s extra-long pre-podcast banter.

They couldnâ€™t hoist a flag and announce, â€œGet lost. This marsh is mine.â€ù Nor could they sidle up next to a fine-feathered cutie and try out their best line.So they made up for these shortcomings by â€” what else? â€” developing bony crests, horns and knobs on their heads.Related Image Expand / ContractResearchers at North Carolina State University have discovered that theropods that developed ornaments on their heads evolved to gigantic body sizes 20 times faster than those that didnâ€™t, and that 20 of the 22 largest theropod species, like T. Rex and Allosaurus, had them.Related: Rare find: T-rex skull will be shown at Seattle museumResearchers Terry Gates and Lindsay Zanno suspect the ornaments served as socio-sexual display mechanisms the dinosaurs would use to signal their mating, territory and defense intentions.Gates and Zanno examined the fossils of 111 ornamented and unornamented theropods and determined that those weighing under 80 pounds did not develop head ornaments, but 20 of 22 above that threshold did.""We were surprised to find such a strong relationship between ornaments and huge body size in theropods,"" Gates said. ""Something about their world clearly favored bling and big bods.""There was an exception, though. The researchers found that the line of dinosaurs that became modern birds, including the ones over 80 pounds, didnâ€™t develop head displays.""The best explanation is that the long stiff feathers, which originated in this group of dinosaurs and were similar to modern bird feathers, could perform equally well as social signals,â€ù Gates said.Added Zanno: ""Our work supports the idea that vaned feathers were great communication tools from the get-go and may have helped large bird-like theropods sidestep the bother of skeletal bells and whistles."""foxnews,2 dome-headed dinosaurs the size of German shepherds discovered,"The discovery of a pair of fossilized skulls from dome-headed dinosaurs is shedding light on how these bizarre creatures called pachycephalosaurs evolved, researchers say.Both of the skulls are relatively complete. One, discovered in the Kaiparowits Formation of Utah, dates to about 76.5 million years ago. The other, found in the Kirtland Formation of New Mexico, is about 73.5 million years old, the researchers said.The location of these skulls â€” in the southern Mountain states â€” indicates that pachycephalosaurids may have diversified in the south before they moved north and gave rise to the pachycephalosaur known as Stegoceras, said study lead researcher David Evans, an associate professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Toronto. [Dinosaur Detective: Find Out What You Really Know]Pachycephalosaurids (which means ""thick-headed lizards"") were bipedal, herbivorous and possibly head-butting dinosaurs that lived during the Cretaceous period (145.5 million to 65.5 million years ago). At that time, a vast seaway divided the eastern part of North America (called Appalachia) from the western part (called Laramidia). Most pachycephalosaurid fossils are found in northern Laramidia, such as modern-day Alberta and Montana, making the two newfound skulls in southern Laramidia rather remarkable discoveries, Evans said.""There have been some fragmentary specimens that have been found as far south as Texas, but having good quality material and relatively complete skulls has been a true rarity,"" Evans told Live Science. ""The two new specimens really stand out in terms of their completeness, and this allows us to get a much better understanding of their anatomy and their relationships.""Both of the pachycephalosaurids were small â€” about the size of a German shepherd, but the Utah specimen was about 20 percent larger than the New Mexico one, Evans said.Bony bumpsDespite their small differences in size, both had unique bony knobs on the back of the skull, which ""is very different from what we've seen in other species before,"" Evans said. The different boney knobs suggested that they were two new genuses (also called genera) and species, Evans said.The pachycephalosaurids likely used these bony knobs as ornamentation â€” as a way to distinguish between different species and to woo mates, Evans said. Perhaps these ornaments, much like the pachycephalosaurids' domed heads, grew larger as the creature matured, he said.Interestingly, a variety of dinosaur groups, including pachycephalosaurids, Tyrannosaurs and Ankylosaurs, moved north around 80 million years ago. It's unclear what caused this northward move, but one idea is that the seaway changed shape, expanding into swaths of land that dinosaurs once inhabited and causing them to leave behind their southern stomping grounds, Evans said.Perhaps one of the pachycephalosaurid populations in the south moved north, and eventually gave rise to Stegoceras, Evans said. In other words, the two new findings suggest that the ""Stegoceras lineage may actually have originated in the southern part of North America, which is unexpected,"" Evans said. ""It tells an interesting story about the evolution of this group that we didn't know before.""The study, which has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, was presented Oct. 27 at the 2016 Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting in Salt Lake City.Original article on Live Science.Copyright 2016 LiveScience, a TechMediaNetwork company.

Terry Branstad as his pick for ambassador to China and asked retired Gen. John Kelly to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Trump announced late Wednesday as well that heâ€™ll nominate Linda McMahon, former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment, as administrator of the Small Business Administration.Pruitt may be the most controversial pick of the four.Pruitt, 48, has been a reliable booster of the fossil fuel industry and a critic of what he derides as the EPA's ""activist agenda.""Representing his state as attorney general since 2011, Pruitt has repeatedly sued the EPA to roll back environmental regulations and other health protections. He joined with other Republican attorneys general in opposing the Clean Power Plan, which seeks to limit planet-warming carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants. Pruitt has argued that curbing carbon emissions would trample the sovereignty of state governments, drive up electricity rates, threaten the reliability of the nation's power grid and ""create economic havoc.""His installment, if confirmed, would mark a significant break with the current EPA approach toward global warming.In an opinion article published earlier this year by National Review, Pruitt suggested the debate over global warming ""is far from settled"" and claimed ""scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.""He also filed court briefs in support of the Keystone XL Pipeline project blocked by the Obama administration, which would have run through his state. And Pruitt sued the EPA over the agency's recent expansion of water bodies regulated under the federal Clean Water Act.""Respect for private property rights have allowed our nation to thrive, but with the recently finalized rule, farmers, ranchers, developers, industry and individual property owners will now be subject to the unpredictable, unsound and often byzantine regulatory regime of the EPA,"" Pruitt said last year.As word of Pruitt's nomination spread Wednesday, environmental and liberal groups quickly responded with condemnation.Public Citizen called him a ""terrible choice,"" saying in a statement: ""Pruitt is cozy with the oil and gas industry and treats the EPA like an enemy.""Business leaders in his home state, however, lauded Pruitt's selection, especially those in the oil and gas industry.""Scott Pruitt is a businessman and public servant and understands the impact regulation and legislation have in the business world,"" said Jeffrey McDougall, chairman of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association. ""His appointment will put rational and reasonable regulation at the forefront.""Fox Newsâ€™ John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report."foxnews,Budweiser debuts shiny red holiday bottles,"Budweiser is getting into the holiday spirit.Just like Starbucks, the beer manufacturer is now selling its brews in limited-edition holiday-themed packaging.Related Image Expand / Contract (Courtesy Budweiser)The all-red look, planned in conjunction with design agency Jones Knowles Ritchie New York, is inspired by the brand's tradition of decorating its 12 U.S. breweries for the holidays.
