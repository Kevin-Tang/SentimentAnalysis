Thatâ€™s the question that the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston will try to answer today â€” the first time a federal appeals court will consider the issue.

At issue is a 2014 New Hampshire law that makes it a crime, punishable by a fine of up to $1,000, for voters to take pictures of their ballots and share them on social media. Enforcement of the law was blocked a year ago by a federal judge, and the state appealed.



Only nine states appear to either explicitly allow ballot selfies or have no currently enforceable state law clearly forbidding it.

Most of the states, 26, explicitly ban it through various laws, including prohibitions on bringing cameras into polling places.

The law is unclear in Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, Ohio, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.

As part of his appearance, the president-elect referenced some relatively specific numbers.â€œI will tell you that United Technologies and Carrier stepped it up,â€ù he said , â€œand now theyâ€™re keeping â€“ actually the numberâ€™s over 1,100 people, which is so great, which is so great.â€ùIs that true? Not exactly. WTHR, the NBC affiliate in Indianapolis, took a closer look and found that the agreement â€œmay not have saved as many factory jobsâ€ù as Trump claimed.

â€œWe found out today that more jobs are leaving than what we originally thought,â€ù [Carrier worker T.J. Bray, whoâ€™s also a communications rep for the union] said. â€œIt seemed like since Thursday, it was 1,100 [jobs saved] then it was maybe 900 and then now weâ€™re at 700. So Iâ€™m hoping it doesnâ€™t go any lower than that.â€ù Union workers got a letter at the plant saying Trumpâ€™s deal with Carrier will save only 730 factory jobs in Indianapolis, plus 70 salaried positions â€“ 553 jobs in the plantâ€™s fan coil lines are still moving to Monterrey, Mexico. All 700 workers at Carrierâ€™s Huntington plant will also lose their jobs.

As for Trumpâ€™s â€œ1,100â€ù figure, the president-elect was apparently including 350 research and development jobs that, according to the local report, â€œwere never going to move to Mexico in the first place. Those were jobs that Carrier said all along would stay in Indianapolis.â€ùHmm. So Trump is directing $7 million to a company thatâ€™s sending more jobs to Mexico than itâ€™s keeping in the U.S.; heâ€™s relying on the opposite policy he promised to pursue as a candidate; and heâ€™s exaggerating the number of saved jobs.This is the president-electâ€™s big public-relations triumph?On a related note, over the weekend, Trump turned to â€“ what else? â€“ Twitter to share some thoughts on his outsourcing policy : â€œ[A]ny business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S. without retribution or consequence, is WRONG! There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies wanting to sell their product, cars, A.C. units etc., back across the border.â€ùOn Sunday, Vice President-elect Mike Pence added that Trump will make these decisions about which companies to punish â€œ on a day-by-day basis .â€ùThis is a pretty ridiculous approach to policymaking. For one thing, with Carrier, Trump has already shown he doesnâ€™t intend to make use of his own policy, undermining the credibility of his threats. For another, Trump canâ€™t unilaterally impose a 35% tariff and Congressâ€™ Republican majority made clear yesterday it strongly opposes this idea.But even looking past this, there are certain conservative principles that are being shredded here. To hear Trump and Pence tell it, the incoming administration intends to arbitrarily punish companies based on whether or not the White House approves of their business decisions, picking winners and losers as Trump deems necessary.Since when is the right comfortable with tactics like these?"msnbc,Trump risks China rift with Taiwan call,"Senator Chris Murphy talks with Rachel Maddow about the complicated relationship between the U.S. and Taiwan and how Donald Trump's phone call with the Taiwanese president has upset 40 years of careful U.S.-China diplomacy.

It was a sunny Sunday morning when the attack began at around 7:55 a.m. By the time the attacks on Pearl Harbor and other military bases were over, 21 ships were sunk or damaged and more than 300 aircraft were damaged or destroyed.

President Franklin Delano Roosevelt famously declared Dec. 7 ""a date which will live in infamy"" in an address to the nation the following day, during which he asked Congress for a declaration of war.

Around 4,000 people are expected to attend the commemoration ceremony at Pearl Harbor, NBC affiliate KHNL in Honolulu reported.

At Wednesday's ceremony, a moment of silence will be held to mark the time that Japanese planes hit their first target in the harbor. Ceremonies will be held at Kilo Pier and at Hickam Air Force Base to commemorate the attack on Hickam Field.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will not attend the ceremony but will visit Pearl Harbor with President Barack Obama at the end of December, marking the first visit by a leader of the country to visit the site of the surprise attack.

""We must never repeat the tragedy of the war,"" Abe said in announcing the visit. ""I would like to send this commitment. At the same time, I would like to send a message of reconciliation between Japan and the U.S.""

Abe is not expected to apologize for the attack in his visit, which will occur Dec. 26 and 27, but will pray for the war dead at the naval base, Abe said in a brief statement.

The U.S. has never apologized for the use of nuclear weapons against Hiroshima and Nagasaki to end the war nearly four years later. Obama in May became the first sitting president to visit a memorial of the bombing in Hiroshima.

The battleship USS Arizona belches smoke as it topples over into the sea. The ship sank with more than 80 percent of its 1,500-man crew, including Rear Adm. Isaac C. Kidd. AP

The USS Arizona, which was struck by a bomb that detonated fuel stores and ammunition, sank and some of the sailors and Marines killed are still in the wreckage.

""We sacrificed 1,177 men on that ship, and I was one of the lucky ones to get off,"" Donald Stratton, 94, recalled at an event in Hawaii Tuesday.

Stratton escaped the ship by crawling hand-over-hand on a thrown ropeline around 70 to 80 feet to a boat, and spent a year in the hospital before receiving a medical discharge. He reenlisted the next year, and was assigned to a destroyer that took part in five invasions. ""It was so hot and I was burned so bad I don't have any fingerprints anymore,"" he said.

The return has been in the works for 20 years and will be completed Dec. 22. The U.S. returned control of Okinawa to Japan in 1972.

""If I can walk, I'll go,"" said Chavez, who lives in San Diego.

Survivors of the USS Arizona said the nation should remember those never made it out.

Louis Conter, 95, who helped pull bodies and people from the flames after the ship exploded, and stayed there until water on the quarterdeck was up to their knees, said, ""People call us heroes, and we're not the heroes. The heroes are the 1,177 who were killed that day.""

""We lived through it and came home and got married and had children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and lived a big life,"" Conter said. ""They lost theirs immediately and they are the ones that should be called the heroes.""

A civilian leader in the Army made the decision to deny an easement to the controversial Dakota Access oil pipeline despite Army Corps of Engineers recommendations that it be granted, according to officials and a document.

Because of the pipeline's size â€” 30 inches in diameter â€” its approval went to Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Jo-Ellen Darcy, an official said.

""Ms. Darcy had the authority to make the decision on behalf of the Department of the Army, and she did so,"" Darcy spokesperson Moira Kelley told NBC News Tuesday evening.

Sunday's decision was hailed as a victory by protesters who oppose the pipeline, saying its construction threatens land believed to be sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and could threaten its drinking water. The activists call themselves ""water protectors.""

Related: Cruel Winter Could Be Another Blow to Pipeline Protesters' Hopes

Darcy said in the memo that more work needs to be done in looking for an alternate route, with greater participation from the tribe.

The memo from Darcy makes clear that her decision ""does not alter the Army's position that the Corps' prior reviews and actions have comported with legal requirements.""

When asked why Assistant Secretary Darcy decided to go against the Corps of Engineers recommendation, Kelley said, ""the Army decided that the totality of circumstances call for additional analysis, a more robust consideration of alternatives, and additional public information.""

Army Secretary Eric Fanning was ""supportive"" of Darcy's decision but ultimately the decision was hers, the spokesperson said.

President Barack Obama appointed Darcy to be Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) in August of 2009.

The pipeline project spanned 1,172 miles and was projected to transport around 470,000 barrels of oil a day, with a maximum capacity of 570,000 barrels a day, according to the memo.

The portion that was to cross Lake Oahe was a half-mile upstream of the northern boundary of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation.

Darcy's memo says that documents which were part of an environmental assessment â€” which included a ""Lake Oahe Crossing Spill Model Discussion"" â€” were marked as confidential due to security concerns and were withheld from the public and the tribe.

If his choice for the Environmental Protection Agency is any indication, Trump Two weeks ago, Donald Trump sat down for a lengthy interview with the New York Times, where he emphasized his commitment to the environment . â€œI will tell you this: Clean air is vitally important,â€ù the president-elect said. â€œClean water â€“ crystal clean water â€“ is vitally important. Safety is vitally important.â€ùIf his choice for the Environmental Protection Agency is any indication, Trump didnâ€™t mean a word of it

Donald Trump intends to select Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, a senior transition official confirmed to NBC News Wednesday â€“ the clearest sign yet the president-elect will pursue an agenda that could undue President Obamaâ€™s climate change legacy.



An ally to the fossil fuel industry, Pruitt has aggressively fought against environmental regulations, becoming one of a number of attorneys general to craft a 28-state lawsuit against the Obama administrationâ€™s rules to curb carbon emissions.





Not to put too fine a point on this, but Scott Pruitt, if confirmed, will be the most anti-environmental EPA chief in history. Heâ€™s practically a caricature of what a ridiculous Republican choice for the agency looks like.



When Trump and one of his adult children met with Al Gore this week, some clung to hopes that the president-elect might temper some of his far-right attitudes and be halfway reasonable when it comes to natural resources. Those hopes now appear quite foolish. Pruittâ€™s nomination is the punchline to a bad joke.



The Oklahomanâ€™s name may seem familiar because of some important New York Times



Most notably, Oklahoma, where Pruittâ€™s office created an alliance in which energy firms, their lobbyists, and state officials A Washington Post report added that Pruitt â€œhas spent much of his energy as attorney general fighting the agency he is being nominated to lead.â€ù That includes Pruittâ€™s refusal to believe in climate change.Not to put too fine a point on this, but Scott Pruitt, if confirmed, will be the most anti-environmental EPA chief in history. Heâ€™s practically a caricature of what a ridiculous Republican choice for the agency looks like.When Trump and one of his adult children met with Al Gore this week, some clung to hopes that the president-elect might temper some of his far-right attitudes and be halfway reasonable when it comes to natural resources. Those hopes now appear quite foolish. Pruittâ€™s nomination is the punchline to a bad joke.The Oklahomanâ€™s name may seem familiar because of some important New York Times reporting two years ago. As we discussed at the time, Americans have probably grown accustomed to thinking about corporate-political alliances in Washington, D.C., with images of well-paid lobbyists working with allied lawmakers to try to curtail environmental safeguards, but the really egregious actions are found at the state level.Most notably, Oklahoma, where Pruittâ€™s office created an alliance in which energy firms, their lobbyists, and state officials effectively worked as partners

The letter to the Environmental Protection Agency from Attorney General Scott Pruitt of Oklahoma carried a blunt accusation: Federal regulators were grossly overestimating the amount of air pollution caused by energy companies drilling new natural gas wells in his state.



But Mr. Pruitt left out one critical point. The three-page letter was written by lawyers for Devon Energy, one of Oklahomaâ€™s biggest oil and gas companies, and was delivered to him by Devonâ€™s chief of lobbying.



â€œOutstanding!â€ù William F. Whitsitt, who at the time directed government relations at the company, said in a note to Mr. Pruittâ€™s office. The attorney generalâ€™s staff had taken Devonâ€™s draft, copied it onto state government stationery with only a few word changes, and sent it to Washington with the attorney generalâ€™s signature. â€œThe timing of the letter is great, given our meeting this Friday with both E.P.A. and the White House.â€ù



Mr. Whitsitt then added, â€œPlease pass along Devonâ€™s thanks to Attorney General Pruitt.â€ù

To be sure, Pruittâ€™s office wasnâ€™t the only one implicated in these cringe-worthy alliances, but his office was the most brazen of the bunch, effectively working hand in glove with Big Oil.



A majority of Americans voted against Donald Trump in this yearâ€™s presidential election, but the Republican is now acting as if heâ€™s been given a powerful mandate to move the nation sharply to the right. When it comes to the environment, the damage will be severe, and in some cases, possibly even irreversible.

And at no time has anybody who has worked with me told me that doing so has cost us good intelligence. (Applause.)

But they do not speak for over a billion Muslims around the world, and they do not speak for American Muslims, including many who wear the uniform of the United States of Americaâ€™s military. If we stigmatize good, patriotic Muslims, that just feeds the terroristsâ€™ narrative. It fuels the same false grievances that they use to motivate people to kill. If we act like this is a war between the United States and Islam, weâ€™re not just going to lose more Americans to terrorist attacks, but weâ€™ll also lose sight of the very principles we claim to defend.â€ù* On American principles: â€œ[O]ver these last eight years, we have demonstrated that staying true to our traditions as a nation of laws advances our security as well as our valuesâ€_.

On each of these points, Donald Trump believes â€“ or at least has said he believes â€“ the exact opposite of the principles Obama outlined yesterday. Trump embraces torture, sees value in divisiveness, wants to treat a religious minority as inherently suspect, exaggerates the terrorist threat, and believes criticism of a president (or in this case, a president-elect) is grounds for a tantrum in the form of angry tweets.In other words, yesterday was about Obamaâ€™s desire to create a contrast between two very different visions â€“ one that works vs. one that doesnâ€™t â€“ in the hopes that his successor might learn to value the former over the latter. Thereâ€™s inherent danger, the president explained, in pursuing the wrong course.Voxâ€™s Zack Beauchamp concluded , â€œThis isnâ€™t the first time a president has left office by warning of a threat inside America â€“ think of George Washingtonâ€™s farewell speech advising against â€˜entangling alliances,â€™ or Dwight Eisenhower coining the now-famous term â€˜military-industrial complexâ€™ in his closing speech.

And with that in mind, when American hospitals start to panic in response to Republican threats, the public ought to take note.

The Washington Post reported yesterday:

The nationâ€™s hospital industry warned President-elect Trump and congressional leaders on Tuesday that repealing the Affordable Care Act could cost hospitals $165 billion by the middle of the next decade and trigger â€œan unprecedented public health crisis.â€ù



The two main trade groups for U.S. hospitals dispatched a letter to the incoming president and Capitol Hillâ€™s top four leaders, saying that the government should help hospitals avoid massive financial losses if the law is rescinded in a way that causes a surge of uninsured patients.





Joann Anderson, the president and CEO of Southeastern Health in Lumberton, North Carolina, told reporters yesterday that hospitals face dangerous and systemic disruptions from the GOPâ€™s plans. â€œA repeal-and-replace initiative is frightening,â€ù



Iâ€™m curious about how easily warnings such as these can be dismissed as trivial. In recent years, Republicans and their allies have reflexively ignored related warnings about the repeal crusade by dismissing the ideologies of the messengers: reports from universities are ignored because scholars are liberals; reports from news organizations are ignored because journalists are liberals; reports based on arithmetic are ignored because math is liberal, and so on.

Duration: {{video.duration.momentjs}}"msnbc,The Republican health care scheme starts to take shape,"Pence added at an Ohio rally last night that the Affordable Care Act will be replaced â€œwith American solutions,â€ù which was a curious thing to say. For one thing, the ACA blueprint came from Mitt Romney, not a foreign government. For another, Pence knows as well as anyone that the reform law has produced amazing results for Americans â€“ most notably in Indiana, where the law has slashed the stateâ€™s uninsured rate by more than a third Nevertheless, the far-right vice president-electâ€™s comments, which are consistent with what congressional GOP leaders have been saying , suggest the fight over Americansâ€™ access to health security is going to get quite intense almost immediately after Inauguration Day.Unwrapping the Republicansâ€™ plans, however, is a little tricky, and some of the coverage has been a little confusing, so letâ€™s take a couple of minutes to set the stage for whatâ€™s to come.They want to repeal the Affordable Care Act for reasons they often struggle to explain accurately. That said, many in the party, including Donald Trump, have said theyâ€™re reluctant to scrap some of the lawâ€™s more popular provisions.As it turns out, protections for consumers with pre-existing conditions â€“ which poll extremely well with the American mainstream, regardless of party, and which Trump has publicly committed to keeping â€“ are proving to be the most important part of the entire debate.Because itâ€™s something of a keystone. As Republicans have discovered, keeping these protections necessarily leads to a series of related provisions â€_ which start to look an awful lot like â€œObamacare.â€ùWrong. GOP policymakers began working on their ACA alternative in the summer of 2009 , and despite frequent assurances that their plan was almost ready, GOP officials have come up with nothing that can serve as the partyâ€™s official solution.Republicans had the luxury, however, of knowing they didnâ€™t actually have to do any real work. The ACA already passed; itâ€™s working; and even if far-right lawmakers figured out how to write an alternative, President Obama wouldnâ€™t sign it into law. GOP officials enjoyed their total lack of responsibility: they could complain endlessly, while casting dozens of meaningless votes to repeal the reform law, knowing that none of it had any practical significance.Now the dog chasing the car caught up to the bumper. Good lord, yes . The ACA isnâ€™t some appendage attached to the nationâ€™s health care system that can be removed with a legislative cleaver; itâ€™s interspersed by design throughout the system. Getting rid of it, without hurting families, the economy, hospitals, states, insurers, and countless businesses, would take effort, patience, expertise, and legislative skills.At least for now, Republicans have no use for effort, patience, expertise, and legislative skills. They want to attack and figure out the details later. Sometime. Eventually. Maybe.Actually, theyâ€™re not. At this point, Republicans donâ€™t agree among themselves about how best to proceed, and while theyâ€™re deliberating, hospitals and insurers are warning GOP officials that clumsily attacking the federal health care system would do enormous damage â€“ with no substantive upsides.The latest polling shows the public appetite for the Republicansâ€™ ACA repeal agenda is far weaker than the party likes to believe â€“ even among Trump voters They really canâ€™t, which is why Republicans have quietly transitioned from â€œrepeal and replaceâ€ù to â€œrepeal and delay.â€ùSoon after the election, when Republicans realized their health care goals were within their grasp, they came up with a strategy in which theyâ€™d repeal the ACA first, but it wouldnâ€™t take effect right away. The scheme would then set a deadline for Congress to pass something new, probably in two or three years.Almost certainly, yes , but congressional Republicans have apparently begun talks with insurers in the hopes of preventing such a crisis.No one has any idea.Yes. The idea is, through â€œrepeal and delay,â€ù there would be a firm deadline, at which point the health care system would effectively collapse. The point would be to create an incentive for policymakers to work something out, knowing that inaction would lead to disaster.Of course it would, but GOP officials worry that pursuing this rationally and responsibly would effectively ensure that the Affordable Care Act remains intact indefinitely, which they consider a politically unpalatable outcome.Thatâ€™s one of the more important details. As Republicans see it, the beauty of â€œrepeal and delayâ€ù is that it gives the GOP some leverage. As the deadline approaches, Republicans would effectively tell Dems, â€œGo along with our lousy reform plan, even if you hate it, even if it hurts a lot of people, because the alternative would be the complete collapse of the entire system â€“ which you donâ€™t want.â€ùIt sure does.To be sure, there are several gaps remaining. We donâ€™t know, for example, what the GOP majority will try to pass through the budget-reconciliation process, which would render a Democratic filibuster in the Senate irrelevant. For that matter, we donâ€™t know if Republicans will do away with filibusters altogether."msnbc,Republican Electoral College member announces opposition to Trump,"



When members of the Electoral College meet in two weeks to officially choose the next president and vice president, most of their votes arenâ€™t automatic. Actual people, effectively anonymous to the American public, will be responsible for casting ballots that decide the election.



And though itâ€™s widely assumed that electors will vote the way theyâ€™re supposed to, history offers plenty of examples of â€œ Add up the states Donald Trump won in this yearâ€™s presidential election, and you end up with 306 electoral votes, more than enough to put the Republican amateur in the White House. In practice, however, thatâ€™s probably not the number heâ€™ll end up with.When members of the Electoral College meet in two weeks to officially choose the next president and vice president, most of their votes arenâ€™t automatic. Actual people, effectively anonymous to the American public, will be responsible for casting ballots that decide the election.And though itâ€™s widely assumed that electors will vote the way theyâ€™re supposed to, history offers plenty of examples of â€œ faithless electors â€ù who go their own way. This year will apparently add to the list: Texasâ€™ Christopher Suprun, pledged to the Trump/Pence ticket, has decided he cannot support the GOP nominees. In a New York Times op-ed , Suprun, a paramedic and 9/11 first-responder, explained his reasoning.

The election of the next president is not yet a done deal. Electors of conscience can still do the right thing for the good of the country. Presidential electors have the legal right and a constitutional duty to vote their conscience. I believe electors should unify behind a Republican alternative, an honorable and qualified man or woman such as Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. I pray my fellow electors will do their job and join with me in discovering who that person should be.



Fifteen years ago, I swore an oath to defend my country and Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. On Dec. 19, I will do it again.





But while I donâ€™t like dashing progressive hopes, itâ€™s worth noting that Suprunâ€™s declaration isnâ€™t likely to change the outcome of the election.



Itâ€™s simply a matter of arithmetic: to deny Trump the presidency, 37 Republican electors would need to break ranks, pushing the president-elect below the 270-vote threshold. Right now, thereâ€™s just one.



Sure, thereâ€™s still time for some Electoral College members to change their minds ahead of the Dec. 19 vote â€“ an event thatâ€™s usually ignored as a ceremonial, pro-forma part of the process â€“ but thereâ€™s no reason to believe 36 other Republican electors are prepared to deny their partyâ€™s candidate the presidency.



That said, Politico



The groupâ€™s members are calling themselves â€œHamilton Electorsâ€ù â€“ named after Alexander Hamilton, who wrote about the Electoral College exercising its own judgment after an election â€“ and these Democrats are This is, of course, exactly what many progressive activists have been hoping for: a Republican elector, driven by a sense of patriotic duty, concluding that Trump simply doesnâ€™t belong in the Oval Office.But while I donâ€™t like dashing progressive hopes, itâ€™s worth noting that Suprunâ€™s declaration isnâ€™t likely to change the outcome of the election.Itâ€™s simply a matter of arithmetic: to deny Trump the presidency, 37 Republican electors would need to break ranks, pushing the president-elect below the 270-vote threshold.

Note that Suprun canâ€™t bring himself to support Trump, but heâ€™s not voting Democratic, either â€“ his op-ed says he intends to back a different Republican. A group of electors from Colorado and the state of Washington, pledged to the Clinton/Kaine ticket, are wondering how far they can go down a similar path.The groupâ€™s members are calling themselves â€œHamilton Electorsâ€ù â€“ named after Alexander Hamilton, who wrote about the Electoral College exercising its own judgment after an election â€“ and these Democrats are considering a plan to elect a non-Trump Republican.

At least eight Democratic electors are promising to defect from Clinton and support a Republican alternative to Trump. [â€_]



The Democratic electors have already revealed that theyâ€™re close to a consensus pick for whom they will vote: Ohio Gov. John Kasich.

Apparently, the idea is, if Democratic electors support a Republican, and a Trump elector (Suprun) supports that same Republican, perhaps other GOP members of the Electoral College will be more inclined to jump on the bandwagon, knowing that at least a member of their own party would be in the White House.



Iâ€™d caution Trump critics from getting their hopes up. For one thing, many states have laws preventing electors from freelancing at the Electoral College (Hamilton Electors are prepared to sue to overturn those untested statutes). For another, thereâ€™s no evidence to suggest 37 Republican electors, including Suprun, have any interest in such a gambit. We donâ€™t even know if Kasich, or someone like him, would consider such a role under these circumstances.



Odds are, the Electoral College will back Trump in two weeks, and heâ€™ll take the oath of office next month. But if that changes, and it starts to look like Trump has a potential problem, the ensuing political crisis will be unlike anything Americans have seen in generations.

Chuck Jones, the president of United Steelworkers 1999, has not been shy to tell publications that Trump broke his promise to save the jobs at the Carrier plant, a pledge on which the president-elect campaigned.

Trump recently proudly proclaimed that he saved 1,000 jobs at the plant, which is untrue. Instead the deal saves 800 positions and in return Carrier's parent company receives $7 million in tax cuts and incentives over 10 years.

Three hundred Carrier jobs are still slated to be sent to Mexico.

Trump did not address the reasons for the feud directly, but instead â€” with no evidence or reason â€” stated via a tweet that Jones had done a terrible job and suggested the union president was the reason companies were leaving the country. A claim that is hyperbolic and baseless.

Chuck Jones, who is President of United Steelworkers 1999, has done a terrible job representing workers. No wonder companies flee country! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 8, 2016

More than an hour later, Trump returned to Twitter to say the lost jobs were the fault of the local union, essentially relieving himself of fault. Trump said the union should ""spend more time working-less time talking. Reduce dues.""

If United Steelworkers 1999 was any good, they would have kept those jobs in Indiana. Spend more time working-less time talking. Reduce dues â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 8, 2016

Of course, dues payments are totally unrelated to Carrier's decision to move the workers jobs to Mexico.

The original tweet came 20 minutes after Jones appeared on CNN and said 550 jobs were still heading for Mexico from Carrier's Indianapolis facility, while 700 jobs from their Huntington facility will also be sent to Mexico.

Jones later told NBC News that ""I tried to correct some of his math and he took exception to it.""

""For him to say I'm a horrible labor leader, I take it as a positive because that must mean that we're doing something so people can earn a decent living wage-wise and benefit-wise,"" Jones added.

Jones said some of Trump's passionate Twitter followers are now harassing him.

""I'm getting threats and everything else from some of his supporters,"" Jones said. ""I'm getting them all day long ?â€” now they're kicked up a notch.""

Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag - if they do, there must be consequences - perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 29, 2016

Since winning the election, Trump has used the social media platform to criticize the cast of Hamilton, China, Boeing, the press in general, the Green Party, Jill Stein, Saturday Night Live, Cuba, protesters and more.

He also tweeted a lie that there were cases of voter fraud, which caused him to lose the popular vote. There is no evidence of voter fraud, and certainly none that would provide the president-elect the more than 2.7 million votes that would allow him to win the popular vote.

In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016

On Twitter, Trump also took credit for saving a Ford plant that was never slated to close.

I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016

If his choice for the Environmental Protection Agency is any indication, Trump Two weeks ago, Donald Trump sat down for a lengthy interview with the New York Times, where he emphasized his commitment to the environment . â€œI will tell you this: Clean air is vitally important,â€ù the president-elect said. â€œClean water â€“ crystal clean water â€“ is vitally important. Safety is vitally important.â€ùIf his choice for the Environmental Protection Agency is any indication, Trump didnâ€™t mean a word of it

Donald Trump intends to select Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, a senior transition official confirmed to NBC News Wednesday â€“ the clearest sign yet the president-elect will pursue an agenda that could undue President Obamaâ€™s climate change legacy.



An ally to the fossil fuel industry, Pruitt has aggressively fought against environmental regulations, becoming one of a number of attorneys general to craft a 28-state lawsuit against the Obama administrationâ€™s rules to curb carbon emissions.





Not to put too fine a point on this, but Scott Pruitt, if confirmed, will be the most anti-environmental EPA chief in history. Heâ€™s practically a caricature of what a ridiculous Republican choice for the agency looks like.



When Trump and one of his adult children met with Al Gore this week, some clung to hopes that the president-elect might temper some of his far-right attitudes and be halfway reasonable when it comes to natural resources. Those hopes now appear quite foolish. Pruittâ€™s nomination is the punchline to a bad joke.



The Oklahomanâ€™s name may seem familiar because of some important New York Times



Most notably, Oklahoma, where Pruittâ€™s office created an alliance in which energy firms, their lobbyists, and state officials A Washington Post report added that Pruitt â€œhas spent much of his energy as attorney general fighting the agency he is being nominated to lead.â€ù That includes Pruittâ€™s refusal to believe in climate change.Not to put too fine a point on this, but Scott Pruitt, if confirmed, will be the most anti-environmental EPA chief in history. Heâ€™s practically a caricature of what a ridiculous Republican choice for the agency looks like.When Trump and one of his adult children met with Al Gore this week, some clung to hopes that the president-elect might temper some of his far-right attitudes and be halfway reasonable when it comes to natural resources. Those hopes now appear quite foolish. Pruittâ€™s nomination is the punchline to a bad joke.The Oklahomanâ€™s name may seem familiar because of some important New York Times reporting two years ago. As we discussed at the time, Americans have probably grown accustomed to thinking about corporate-political alliances in Washington, D.C., with images of well-paid lobbyists working with allied lawmakers to try to curtail environmental safeguards, but the really egregious actions are found at the state level.Most notably, Oklahoma, where Pruittâ€™s office created an alliance in which energy firms, their lobbyists, and state officials effectively worked as partners

The letter to the Environmental Protection Agency from Attorney General Scott Pruitt of Oklahoma carried a blunt accusation: Federal regulators were grossly overestimating the amount of air pollution caused by energy companies drilling new natural gas wells in his state.



But Mr. Pruitt left out one critical point. The three-page letter was written by lawyers for Devon Energy, one of Oklahomaâ€™s biggest oil and gas companies, and was delivered to him by Devonâ€™s chief of lobbying.



â€œOutstanding!â€ù William F. Whitsitt, who at the time directed government relations at the company, said in a note to Mr. Pruittâ€™s office. The attorney generalâ€™s staff had taken Devonâ€™s draft, copied it onto state government stationery with only a few word changes, and sent it to Washington with the attorney generalâ€™s signature. â€œThe timing of the letter is great, given our meeting this Friday with both E.P.A. and the White House.â€ù



Mr. Whitsitt then added, â€œPlease pass along Devonâ€™s thanks to Attorney General Pruitt.â€ù

To be sure, Pruittâ€™s office wasnâ€™t the only one implicated in these cringe-worthy alliances, but his office was the most brazen of the bunch, effectively working hand in glove with Big Oil.



A majority of Americans voted against Donald Trump in this yearâ€™s presidential election, but the Republican is now acting as if heâ€™s been given a powerful mandate to move the nation sharply to the right. When it comes to the environment, the damage will be severe, and in some cases, possibly even irreversible.

Duration: {{video.duration.momentjs}}"msnbc,The curious company Trump's HHS Secretary keeps,"[T]he bright-red warning flags go beyond Priceâ€™s policy stances. The congressman also belongs to a truly radical medical organization known as the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons. And when you look into the specifics of what that group espouses itâ€™s hard not to shudder a little bit extra hard.Science Blogs managing editor David Gorski, himself a surgeon, summed up what he knows about the AAPS in a helpful blog post . The short version is that the organization stands at direct odds, in myriad ways, with some of very foundational beliefs of evidence-based modern public-health research. As Gorski explains, the organization takes what is basically an Ayn Rand-ian view of the medical world in which doctors are brilliant superheroes constantly undermined by government meddling in the forms of demands for evidence and accountability and things like that.

A Mother Jones piece from a few years ago added, â€œ[D]espite the lab coats and the official-sounding name, the docs of the AAPS are hardly part of mainstream medical society. Think Glenn Beck with an MD.â€ùThe Association of American Physicians and Surgeons last came up a few years ago when Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who has all kinds of weird scientific beliefs, noted his affiliation with the group. It wasnâ€™t encouraging: the organization has expressed â€œdoubts about the connection between HIV and AIDS and suggested that President Barack Obama may have been elected because he was able to hypnotize voters.â€ù The AAPS has also peddled discredited claims about vaccines and autism.The New York article added, â€œ[T]he AAPS isnâ€™t the sort of group you join if you have any faith in government or belief that it can meaningfully help people; rather, itâ€™s the sort of organization you join if you want to drag the world back to a time when individual patients were on their own, batted to and fro by indifferent markets, with effectively no recourse to fight against quackery, fraud, and other forms of medical malfeasance.â€ùUnder more sensible political conditions, membership in this organization would make it difficult for a politician to become the nationâ€™s HHS Secretary, but in 2016, Republicans probably wonâ€™t care.In fairness, itâ€™s not at all clear whether or not Price actually believes all of the wild-eyed nonsense peddled by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, and itâ€™s certainly possible he rejects some of the groupâ€™s more extreme nuttiness.But it should make for some interesting Q&A during his confirmation hearing, shouldnâ€™t it? â€œCongressman, if you donâ€™t agree with the groupâ€™s radical ideas, why are you a member?

The GOP-led House Science Committee thought it was insightful and worth sharing to a broader audience.The committee is led by Rep.

Duration: {{video.duration.momentjs}}"msnbc,Leading GOP obstructionist decries 'senseless obstruction',"Letâ€™s take a minute to unwrap this, because itâ€™s one of the more jarring quotes of the year.First, listening to votersâ€™ voices isnâ€™t a bad idea, but in the most recent election cycle, voters (a) preferred Hillary Clinton by a considerable margin; (b) shrunk the Republican majorities in both chambers; and (c) keep telling pollsters that theyâ€™re not on board with the GOPâ€™s repeal plans.Second, for John Barrasso to decry â€œsenseless obstructionâ€ù without appreciating the irony is completely bonkers. The far-right Wyoming senator has been almost obstructionist when it comes to health care policy in recent years, at one point going so far as to demand that officials â€œ stop celebrating â€ù good news related to the ACA reform effort.But even if we look past these highly relevant details, Barrasso seems to genuinely believe Democrats should â€œwork closelyâ€ù with Republicans hellbent on tearing down the existing health care system and replacing it with some alternative no one can identify. The response from Democratic leaders, in effect, has been, â€œUm, no.â€ùAnd if Barrasso and other Republicans find that surprising, they havenâ€™t been paying close enough attention.Overcoming enormous obstacles, Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, which is one of the greatest progressive policy achievements in a generation. It brought coverage to 20 million Americans; it pushed the nationâ€™s uninsured rate to its lowest point on record; it lowered prescription-drug costs for millions of seniors; it helped spur job growth throughout the health industry; and itâ€™s literally saved lives.Republicans, including Barrasso, tried to sabotage the reform law every step of the way, taking steps unseen at any point in the American tradition. They refused to compromise; they refused to work in good faith towards policy solutions; and they even shut down the government at one point as part of a bizarre anti-health-care tantrum.Itâ€™s against this backdrop that Republicans, realizing that theyâ€™ll need 60 votes in the Senate to make a variety of key changes, are going to Democrats and effectively saying, â€œHow about you ignore everything you know about the last eight years and work with us on dismantling one of your partyâ€™s signature accomplishments?â€ùI know how Iâ€™d respond if I were a Senate Dem, but the phrasing that comes to mind wouldnâ€™t be appropriate for publication on a family blog.The ideal approach for Democrats seems obvious: they should assure Barrasso and his cohorts that theyâ€™ll approach the GOPâ€™s reform initiative with just as much cooperation and bipartisanship that Republicans demonstrated over the last eight years."msnbc,NATO Secy General: 'Trump is committed to NATO',"John Kerry is assuring European leaders of America's continuing support of NATO.

Duration: {{video.duration.momentjs}}"msnbc,Why the GOP will regret making health care promises it can't keep,"Most Republican leaders have coalesced around a health care strategy called â€œrepeal and delay,â€ù which we discussed late last week. The basic idea is that GOP officials, once they take control of every lever of federal power, will pass a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but delay the implementation for a few years, leaving â€œObamacareâ€ù intact until at least 2019.Between now and then, the gambit will move on to its second phase: Republicans will use those three years to come up with their own ACA alternative, an effort thatâ€™s already been ongoing for seven years, to no avail.There are all kinds of problems with this scheme, which weâ€™ll cover in more detail as the process moves forward, and with the House Freedom Caucus already balking , itâ€™s not a foregone conclusion that â€œrepeal and delayâ€ù can pass. But putting that aside for now, itâ€™s worth pausing to appreciate the health-care promises Republicans are making â€“ which they almost certainly wonâ€™t be able to keep.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) talked to â€œ60 Minutesâ€ù the other day, and told CBSâ€™s Scott Pelley that ACA repeal will be â€œthe first billâ€ù Congress tackles in January. When the correspondent asked if Republicans are â€œpulling the rug out from under the 20 million people,â€ù the Republican leader said, â€œNo, no,â€ù as if the very idea was absurd.â€œWe want to make sure that we have a good transition period, so that people can get better coverage at a better price,â€ù Ryan said. The Speaker then committed to protecting consumers with pre-existing conditions â€“ he called it â€œa very important feature of any health-care systemâ€ù â€“ and allowing young adults to stay on their parentsâ€™ plan until the age of 26. It led to this exchange:

Yesterday, the Speaker added , in an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, that the Republican approach will make sure that â€œno one is left out in the coldâ€ù and â€œno one is worse off.â€ùRyanâ€™s writing checks that his party canâ€™t cash.Look, health care policy is extremely complex, as Republicans have no doubt noticed. Theyâ€™ve been working on an â€œObamacareâ€ù alternative since the summer of 2009, frequently promising to unveil a bold new plan, only to produce nothing. Under â€œrepeal and delay,â€ù GOP lawmakers believe theyâ€™ll have greater success â€“ theyâ€™ll face an actual deadline, and failure would mean the collapse of the American insurance market â€“ though they havenâ€™t the foggiest idea what their blueprint will look like or when itâ€™ll be ready.They are, however, publicly committing to some rather specific baselines. The Republican health care plan will:* Protect Americans with pre-existing conditions* Protect young adults* Give â€œeveryoneâ€ù in the country access to â€œaffordable health-care coverageâ€ù* Offer consumers â€œbetter coverage at a better priceâ€ù* Create a system in which â€œno oneâ€ù is â€œworse offâ€ù than they are nowDonald Trump, incidentally, has also publicly committed to some of these same basic principles.And while I certainly wish Republicans the best of luck in their endeavor, Iâ€™m afraid theyâ€™ll soon discover what should be obvious: there is no way to keep these promises. If they repeal the Affordable Care Act, and look for a conservative alternative plan that meets all of the tenets Paul Ryan has now presented, they will fail. If such a policy could exist, GOP officials wouldâ€™ve come up with it a long time ago.And when Republicans fail to produce a proposal that meets the partyâ€™s own benchmarks, it will result in a broken promise that puts millions of familiesâ€™ health security at risk for no reason other than craven partisanship.As Bloombergâ€™s Jonathan Bernstein joked yesterday, Republicansâ€™ best bet is probably to take the Affordable Care Act, slap a new GOP-friendly name on it, and â€œpretend theyâ€™ve â€˜replacedâ€™ Obamacare with a new, market-based solution.â€ùIf Republicans are lucky, opposition to â€œrepeal and delayâ€ù will grow, the gambit will fail, and GOP officials will be able to move on to some other issue."msnbc,Climate change advocates worry about Trump,"The new documentary â€œBefore the Flood,â€ù focuses on the impact of climate change and questions humanityâ€™s ability to reverse it.

The latter is made up of people who arenâ€™t just ill-suited to lead a cabinet agency, but who are also ridiculous political personalities who have no business even being considered for important federal responsibilities. Liberty Universityâ€™s Jerry Falwell Jr., for example, said Donald Trump



Betsy DeVos, apparently Trumpâ€™s When it comes to choosing the personnel for his top administrative posts, Donald Trumpâ€™s selections have thus far fallen into two broad categories: the conventionally wrong and the unconventionally wrong.The latter is made up of people who arenâ€™t just ill-suited to lead a cabinet agency, but who are also ridiculous political personalities who have no business even being considered for important federal responsibilities. Liberty Universityâ€™s Jerry Falwell Jr., for example, said Donald Trump offered him the job of Education Secretary, which the right-wing Virginian turned down for personal reasons. Eyeing Falwell for such a post is unconventionally wrong.Betsy DeVos, apparently Trumpâ€™s second choice for the Department of Education, is merely conventionally wrong.

President-elect Donald Trump picked Betsy DeVos to be his education secretary Wednesday, putting an outspoken advocate of charter schools and school vouchers in Americaâ€™s top education post. [â€_]



DeVos, a 58-year-old billionaire philanthropist from Michigan, leads the American Federation for Children, which promotes charter school education. Sheâ€™s married to Dick DeVos, an heir to the Amway fortune, and is the sister to Erik Prince, founder of notorious government-contracted security company Blackwater, now known as Academi.





That is, however, cold comfort when it comes public policy. DeVos has been a fierce opponent of public education, which is why Trump choosing her for Secretary of Education suggests the incoming Republican administration is planning a pretty aggressive confrontation with public schools.



Indeed, DeVosâ€™ record is long and unambiguous. The Michigan Republican has spent millions from her familyâ€™s Amway fortune to promote school vouchers as part of a campaign to privatize public education. The New York Times I donâ€™t mean â€œconventionalâ€ù as a compliment. DeVos, a Republican mega-donor, is a far-right ideologue with misguided ideas whoâ€™ll very likely do a bad job. But sheâ€™s also very much in line with expectations in a Trump/Pence team â€“ and itâ€™s easy to imagine a President Kasich, Cruz, Bush, or Rubio picking the exact same person for the exact same job.That is, however, cold comfort when it comes public policy.

The Michigan Republican has spent millions from her familyâ€™s Amway fortune to promote school vouchers as part of a campaign to privatize public education. The New York Times reported the other day:

It is hard to find anyone more passionate about the idea of steering public dollars away from traditional public schools than Betsy DeVos, Donald J. Trumpâ€™s pick as the cabinet secretary overseeing the nationâ€™s education system.



For nearly 30 years, as a philanthropist, activist and Republican fund-raiser, she has pushed to give families taxpayer money in the form of vouchers to attend private and parochial schools, pressed to expand publicly funded but privately run charter schools, and tried to strip teacher unions of their influence. [â€_]



Ms. DeVosâ€™s efforts to expand educational opportunity in her home state of Michigan and across the country have focused little on existing public schools, and almost entirely on establishing newer, more entrepreneurial models to compete with traditional schools for students and money. Her donations and advocacy go almost entirely toward groups seeking to move students and money away from what Mr. Trump calls â€œfailing government schools.â€ù"msnbc,MSNBC,"MSNBC is the premier destination for breaking news and in-depth analysis of the headlines, as well as commentary and informed perspectives.
